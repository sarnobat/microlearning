==== Chapter 1: The birth of Atlético Aviación ====

As it's usually said, let's start by the beginning. Some ignorant using Internet have thrown to the world this sentence: “Atlético Aviación (current Atlético de Madrid) a team created during the Civil War by the Fascist Army that used later the Francoist Government's assistance to win two Ligas. [TN:* Real] Madrid remained in the capital as the only Republican team”. The nonsense accumulation in three lines is so remarkable that I'm going to be part by part, and on this occasion I will answer the question: “Where did Atlético Aviación come from?”. Prepare yourself because although I'll try to summarize I'm not going to promise anything.

Let's start by Atleti. What was their sport situation when the War begun? The Athletic Club (named “de Madrid” to identify their home city and not because it was part of their name) played the season 35-36 in Primera División to finally be relegated to Segunda after a dramatic match against Sevilla in Madrid that ended 2-3 (the one of the famous -although unknown for those who lie- penalty missed by Chacho in the final minutes).

During the War, Athletic Club as other teams reduced their activity to the minimum, although they play some charity matches, for example one against a team created by Republican soldiers named “Batallón Deportivo”.

Far from Madrid, and in their own, another team created during the military conflict, the Aviación Nacional, was born in Salamanca in the Matacán air base during mid 1937, counting on voluntary and replacement soldiers, with the end of playing charity matches against other military teams, obviously from the same side.

However, during summer 1938 the Battle of the Ebro provoked the move of Franco's General Headquarters to Zaragoza, so the air force team went there. They played friendly games against Racing de Santander, Alavés, Zaragoza and Real Unión among others, as well as official matches playing as a “proper club”. This way, they participated in the Campeonato Regional de Aragón, winning it after beating (in official matches I insist) Recuperación de Levante, 80ª Compañía de Automovilismo, and in the final Real Zaragoza in their old stadium “Campo de Torrero”. Note that Aviación Nacional weren't precisely the only military or Nationalist team created during the Civil War. Three years were a long time, and it isn't strange that the military sphere were the only place where sports activities were carried out in a society where the civil population had enough worrying about escaping or surviving at all costs.

The “flying” victory in the Campeonato Regional allowed them to participate in the 1st Copa del Generalísimo [TN: name given to “Copa del Rey” during Francoist Spain] where they knocked-out Betis in the round of 16, losing to Sevilla CF in quarterfinals with a refereeing in the second leg that some contemporary reporters valued as favourable to the Seville team. In fact, the “referee” [TN:* original in English] whistled the full-time some minutes before because Sevilla fans invaded the pitch when they scored the 4th goal that gave them the qualification. Quite strange regarding the Franco's team that received favours to win, isn't it? But let's go on.

The War is over the April 1st 1939 and Aviación Nacional, far from wanting to disappear, set their HQ (or just domicile) in Madrid, Paseo Martínez Campos 30, and their contact person was Alférez [2nd Lieutenant] Salamanca.

Obviously, there was a problem. After the end of the War, the air force team had nowhere to land, and although they had participated in the 1st Copa del Generalísimo they can't be just added to Primera or Segunda División. They could have begun from the regional tiers and follow the tortuous promotions path to the top tiers, but that idea wasn't considered by the blue board. A merge with an existent team was necessary.

It's true that the idea of getting along with Aviación Nacional was interesting not only for the military, but also for the main Madrilenian teams. The first team that ran to pay their respects and ask for long lasting relations to Martínez Campos 30 was Madrid Club de Fútbol (the “Real” was taking off the name during the II Republic), through one of their most relevant leaders Don Pedro Parages. A question is raised: Wasn't Madrid, according to that uneducated guy, the Republican team? Nope. They ran like deer to join the “Fascist Air Force”, fact that, in the other hand, was the first option considered by the blue soldiers.

Nevertheless, the deal wasn't reached. The reasons weren't related to the supposed Madridista republicanism. The reported reasons were the Aviadores high pretensions, especially those regarding the presence of officers in their board, something that they didn't accept (I insist, not because ideological questions) because the fusion would mean “too many roosters in the same pen”. Also, they were bothered by the presence of the word “Aviación” in the future club's name, relegating Madrid to a secondary level, as well as the modification of the crest to include the Aviación coat of arms, although those were minor discrepancies regarding the above-mentioned point.

Madrid's renounce opened two new options to Aviación Nacional. The first one was the Nacional de Madrid, team from Chamberí Neighbourhood. The advantages of this alternative were evident: Nacional owns a pitch (“El Parral”, close to “Las Ventas” bullfight arena), and regarding the name, the soldiers wouldn't even have to change theirs because the merged team's name would be Aviación Nacional.

The other option was Athletic Club (de Madrid). The War had destroyed a club in crisis after the 1936 relegation. They didn't even own a pitch to play because the Metropolitano had been devastated because it was the first defense line in the front of Moncloa and Ciudad Universitaria during the siege of Madrid. However, they offered a place in Segunda División, something that Nacional [de Madrid] couldn't. They offered their board's long experience and a squad that still had important pre-War players, like Guillermo, Mesa, Gabilondo, Elícegui or Arencibia. Other players were unusable as they were waiting to be distributed in POW camps, hidden after fighting for the Republican Side (coño, wasn't Atleti the Fascist team?), they had fled with the Basque Team (like Urquiola), or they had fallen in combat (Ángel Arocha).

The Aviadores would contribute their organization, matured during the War, some own funds (not too much as the time will prove), the military infrastructure, big deal in a destroyed Spain (buses for the trips, food…) and a sports team quite interesting with the famous Ricardo Zamora as manager and a good number of players that will become Spanish Football legends, like Germán, Machín, Aparicio, Campos, Vázquez, etc.

Then the interest was mutual, but for the rojiblancos it was a crucial question. The Atlético board members Touzón, Fernández Cabello and Galíndez exposed to the rest of members that in case of not reaching an agreement with the Voladores there was a real risk of disappearing. The stances came closer, and finally, the October 4th 1939 in the Athletic locals in Calle Alcalá, the agreements were signed creating the Athletic Aviación Club, presided by the Commandant Francisco Vivés. The name Atlético Aviación came a year later when the foreign words were banned from the football teams (among others, Atlético de Bilbao, Real Gijón and Real Santander were born).

Atlético Aviación crest

We are back today to debunk another accusation over Atlético Aviación's history, and thus, over Atlético de Madrid. Journalists with reputed past, but null information, threw to the world the next lie: "In 1939 a play-off was invented against Osasuna with the objective of promoting Atlético Aviación to Primera". Using different words, but the same misinformation (and bad blood), Francisco Yagüe in 1990 mentioned this on Diario 16 (TN: former Spanish generalist newspaper) in the article: "Anniversaries to forget". Later, others extended his work, and some of them went full idiots denouncing that: "To put Atlético Aviación in Primera, Oviedo were forced to renounce their spot".

After breathing for some minutes (it is hard to digest such a huge avalanche of bullshit with no anesthetic), let's go, as always, with the facts contrasted on the history books.

Before starting, I would like to thank Fernando Sánchez, Communications Ph.D because of his thesis: "Sports documentary sources applied to the history of a Spanish sports club: Club Atlétido de Madrid History, because of his help to contrast and increase my sources.

Aviación Nacional Shirt | Atlético Aviación Shirt (source)

As I said on the last chapter, Athletic Club (de Madrid) had been relegated to Segunda División in 1936, and that was the tier where Atlético Aviación were supposed to play. However, and to everyone's surprise, Oviedo asked the Federation for a temporary absence because their disastrous economical, social and sports situation, and to be allowed to join the competition later. It is important to remember that before the Civil War Oviedo were a team settled in Primera División, 4th in the 1936 liga, and they had Isidro Lángara, the greatest Spanish pre-war player (max scorer in seasons 33/34, 34/35 and 35/36). After the War, Oviedo had lost a large number of their players (the fight in Asturias was specially bloody), Lángara himself had fled out of Spain with the Euzkadi team, and their Buenavista stadium was literally wrecked: the tribune smashed (the wood had been used as firewood) and a big trench divided the pitch in two. They had no means to resume their activity, and thus, the Asturian team requested to be temporarily excluded from la Liga.

Oviedo's stadium after the War

The Spanish Federation, after Oviedo's absence, begin to plan the calendar with an 11 teams league (one had to rest each week). However, Club Atlético Osasuna claimed their right to play in Primera according to an agreement from the Federation Directive Board on June 26th of 1938 where the Osasuna team was granted a spot in the first tier to thank the services rendered by the Navarre people to the Nationalist Side during the Civil War. This decision was endorsed by the Federation during the first assembly held after the War. This is for those who talk about "Teams of the Government". I wonder how are they going to tell this to the Indar Gorri... (TN: Osasuna Ultras, left winged and Basque nationalists)

Of course, if this reason was enough to play in Primera, it was understandable that several requests came from Coruña, Vigo and Ceuta hoisting the Francoist flag: "I was fighting against the rojos too and I deserve more than anybody to play in Primera".

Liga 1935/36 final table

However, those war merits were totally against the sport rules, because after Oviedo's renounce, the team that had better results during the last season was Athletic Club (de Madrid), second-to-last in Primera División in 1936, being Osasuna the last one, despite going to be "promoted by arms".

Francisco Vives Camino, Athletic Aviación president in 1939

The Aviator directors pulled their relevant influences in the Federation claiming that they had more merits to play in Primera according to the purely sports rules, and after several deliberations, it was decided that the political candidate (Osasuna) and the sports candidate (Athletic) had to settle the issue in a play-off match played on a neutral ground. This "solomonic" decision raised great controversy, and not favoring Athletic Aviación, who were the ones making concessions to the non-football interests, but favoring Osasuna, who appealed against the National Council of Sports. Even some doubts were raised about the "Francoism" of the Federation members that made the decision, and that is why the ruling of the Council adds some odd final explanations:

"Unanimous judgment:

The executive commission, after a careful study of the quoted antecedents, unanimously decides:

FIRST: Confirming the appealed agreement, the circumstantially vacant spot in Primera División de Liga de Clubs de Fútbol shall be granted to the team winning the match between CLUB ATLETICO OSASUNA and ATHLETIC-AVIACION in Valencia the day 26 OF CURRENT MONTH

SECOND: The public campaign carried out by external elements with objectives outside the sport is reprehensible and should be punished.

THIRD: The attacks to the Federación Española de Fútbol and their members are totally slanderous and should be punished as the EXECUTIVE COMMISSION totally endorse their honor and their total adhesion to the glorious NATIONAL MOVEMENT"

In summary, the "invented promotion" (according to the undocumented) favoring Athletic Aviación, was actually a cession by the red and white aviators of their legitimate sport right to favor Osasuna, whose merits were reduced to their boldness fighting for Franco's troops. Neither more nor less.

Play-off match line-up (source)

To complete the information, the play-off match was celebrated in Mestalla the November 26th 1939 (TN: there is a typo in the original article) with a 3-1 result favoring the Madrileños with two goals by Enrique and one by Vázquez to complete the comeback after the goal by Vergara. It was confirmed in the pitch what the politics have tried to take away: Atlético Aviación's sports right to play in the top Spanish tier.

PS: The Federation kept Oviedo's spot and they were reincorporated to Primera División in season 1940-41, but that's another story

CHAPTER 3: "The Regime's Team
Picture 1

Athletic Aviación players making the mandatory salute before a match

Many people comment or accuse directly Atlético Aviación of being the team supported by the Francoist Government, putting into question any accomplishment achieved by Atlético during the Post-War, but lacking any sourced argument. This is not just done by the undocumented Internet guys that were quoted in the First Chapter of this series. Some alleged historians (or “storians” as Bernardo de Salazar calls them), jump without parachute to the malicious field of the suggestions. This way, Carlos Fernández Santander writes these deceiving and coward lines: “Funny enough (or not), Liga and Copa were won that first year by two teams of evident pro-regime significance: the semi-militarized Atlético Aviación (sic) that went from being relegated to Segunda División to Champion of Primera, and Español, representing the Spanish essences in Catalonia”. We can read even the reputed Duncan Shaw in a similar fashion: “It is not surprising that Atlético Aviación won the first two ligas after the Civil War; perhaps it is more surprising that the official aid was not enough to let them win more trophies before regaining their independence and original name in 1946”. That is, suggestions, reflections, veiled attacks with no proofs: just gut feelings.

We are going to check the history (something that neither the “storians” nor the plain liars had the decency to do) and we are going to see the extent of those presumed advantages for Atlético that would make them look like a sort of “Iberian Steaua from the 40s”.

Again, I sincerely thank Fernando Sánchez because of his selfless collaboration to write this article.

Picture 2

"I warned you that this chair (silla) wasn't for Sevilla"

The truth is that Atlético Aviación were nicknamed “The team of the millionaires” during the early 40’s (vouched by the great fullback Aparicio), although it was not because they kept millions in the bank. The participation in the board by the Air Force granted them some privileges, like the unlimited use of vehicles and gasoline in their trips, and the right to choose any player serving in the Air Force, with a first option over those in the Land Army. Also, like many other entities dependant of the Army, they received a subsidy from the General-Minister Yagüe. Anyway they were not the only Spanish football team receiving state aid during the 40s, but that is another issue.

There is no doubt that the hands given to the Aviators were interesting, especially during a time when Spain was in ruins. In fact, the advantage of traveling on military vehicles was not petty if you look at the conditions suffered by other teams during their travels (many on regular trains, and not in Business Class precisely), who had it way more difficult.

Picture 3

Well, Atleti were not rich, but indeed “economically viable”. Rhetorical question: Was that enough to consider that they won two Ligas thanks to the Fascist Power? Let us continue. It is also said that the Aviator team had influence to pull strings at the Federación. Once discarded any kind of benefit to access the top tier (see the previous chapter about the right to play in Primera), there is only one instance where, although favorable treatment is not proved, the red and white team shows some weigh when it comes to get official support for their interests. I am talking about the transfer from the Cantabrian player Germán from Racing to Athletic Aviación after the War. The intense efforts by the red and white executive Cesáreo Galíndez counted on the priceless Castilian Football Federation mediation. Just that. They defended one of their clubs' interests against those of a club that was under another regional federation (TN: teams from Madrid were affiliated to the Castilian Federation, Racing de Santander was affiliated to the Cantabrian Federation). Following the law, and without urgently adapting or changing rules to allow transfers. I am talking about Kubala to Barcelona and Di Stéfano to Real Madrid cases (that was really pulling strings…). Let us go on.

Picture 4

Works to replant the grass in Vallecas

I wonder: if Athletic Aviación were the Government’s team, how can you explain their struggle to have their own field after the War? I mean, the Metropolitano was wrecked, so Athletic had the option of playing at Vallecas. However, the Vallecano field, according to Salazar, had no grass, so it was not allowed to host Primera División matches according to the federative rules. It was necessary to replant the grass, and that provoked than the Aviators’ local stadium was not available until the last match of the league (TN: there were no "grass rolls" back then. They have to plant the seeds and let them grow). Notice that that was their second option because the Metropolitano was being slowly rebuilt by their slacking owners and took longer to be available.

Picture 5

December 10th, 1939. First match for Athletic Aviación as locals...at Chamartín

In this situation, the red and whites had to ask their neighbour Madrid CF to cede their Chamartín stadium for the Atlético local matches (TN: The "Chamartín stadium" was later named "Santiago Bernabéu", yes, Athletic Aviación had to play at Santiago Bernabéu). The Whites accepted, but with one condition: their members (TN: Socios) were allowed to attend the Athletic Aviación matches for free. For the whole season, Athletic Aviación players suffered the rages and jeers from the Madridista fans, who noisily cheered the Colchonero opponents every Sunday. Whoever they were. The situation sometimes reached the point of confrontation between the Aviación players (supposedly home players) and the Merengue public, and this provoked that the very upset players were punished (e.g Elícegui and Blanco were fined 100 pesetas after the match against Betis at Chamartín because of their obscene gestures to the hostile “local” crowd). The hostile atmosphere suffered by Athletic (Atlético months later) during their “local” games was so obvious that the Castilian Federation condemned the situation (no fines or suspensions, of course). This is an extract from one of their notes: “This passion to cheer a third team when their triumph does not benefit neither directly nor indirectly our team and the hostility to the home team to exclusively benefit the guest team infers a great harm to the regional [Castilian] football”.

Picture 6

ABC Newspaper, December 17th 1939, report about the fines to Elícegui and Blanco

I wonder again: things did not look too easy, despite they were the Francoist Government team, did they?

Another isolated episodes neither confirm the “Government team” theory. I am talking about the dark and surprising imprisonment of their coach Ricardo Zamora on year 1940 because he had left Spain through the “Red Zone” longer than the allowed time during the War (two months). That is the official version. The informal version, published by some contemporary newspapers, was that he was imprisoned “because he was red” (TN: “un rojo”), or more clearly because he was the friend of a red, that was the same during those years. Zamora even had to gave up his coach position for several weeks.

It is surprising how in this case the Francoist Government acted with iron fist and dubious justice against their “presumed team”.

Picture 7

And what were the benefits on the pitch? As I say, there are many unsourced comments about the supposed support that helped Atlético Aviación to win two ligas. The truth is that both were won, as Maradona would say “shitting”, suffering according to the history. Even in the first one the players finished their last match thinking that the tournament had been won by Sevilla, who were playing in Alicante with a favourable score. Some minutes later, a phone call confirmed, for the players’ surprise and joy, that Hércules had finally tied the match against Sevilla, giving Atlético the title. Next year Atlético won again at the last match, although this time they did not depend on other matches. Too much suspense in my opinion, considering that the Ligas had been “assigned beforehand”...

Picture 8

Marca cover: Atlético Aviación 5 - Real Santander (i.e. Racing) 0

Then, if the Francoist bigwigs were the ones granting the titles, why did the Aviators not also win the Copas del Generalísimo (TN: Francoist “Copa del Rey”) and the next ligas for the bigger glory of the “National Movement”? The truth is that Atlético did not win any title more as “de Aviación”, and the four next ligas were won by Valencia, Atlético de Bilbao (TN: Remember: foreign names were already banned), Barcelona and Sevilla. Were they Fascist too, or these teams won right and square? Even in these years there were two seasons (1942/43 and 1945/46) where Atleti sweated blood to stay far from the relegation. I was told that they were winning by decree.

Picture 9

Marca cover: At. Aviación 5 - Alicante 1

Well, a lot of nonsense has been said about Atlético Aviación, and most of it with no sources, following the Spanish saying: “if you slander something will remain” (TN: “Difama, que algo queda”).

Then, why did Atlético won the two leagues following the Civil War? I quote the words by Francisco Vivés, first president of Athletic Aviación regarding this issue:

Picture 10

Marca cover: Athletic Aviación champion of la Liga 1939/40

“Athletic Aviación were easy to manage because their players were from the military or assimilated, so there was no place for discussion and the discipline was a natural part of their daily duties. The merge connected the Air Force and Atlético de Madrid in a way that the first Atlético Aviación stars would be Germán, Vázquez, Campos, Aparicio, Arencibia… that had been Air Force soldiers. In the same way, contemporary official documents prove that the Air Force officials publicized Atlético Aviación among the troops under their command, so those who voluntary wanted to help the development of the sport could became members of a club working under the Air Force patronage[...] The team traveled on Air Force buses. Everything was done right, and the results were perfect”.

Picture 11

Neither a single report nor proof of max-fixing, steals or another dishonest behavior favoring the Aviators. In this series of articles there is a summary of the facts. Now people can lie or make up facts, or they can read and document themselves.

-Víctor Hegelman.


To add on this, here is the article that ABC (pro-regime newspaper) wrote after Athletic Aviación won la Liga (in Spanish). Notice that there is no mention how cool is for Franco, the Regime or "the National Movement" that Atlético Aviación had won (it would have been a good chance to do so if they were actually Franco's team). They say that Aviación were the most consistent team during the season and that they have better squad depth that the rest of teams.

=== Madrid – Estadio Metropolitano ===
by Chris Clements | Posted on Tuesday, April 10th, 2012

How can I say this politely? Well, it's like this… Atlético Madrid has played around a bit. There you go, I've said it. You see, between its formation in 1903 and moving to their present home in October 1966, Atléti changed venues on ten occasions. Sometimes they played in the the east of Madrid, sometimes to the west, and occasionally they were Real Madrid's tenants, but throughout this period, the club's one true home was the Estadio Metropolitano.

(An early 20th century Sporting Metropolis – the Calle O'Donnell)

Founded on 26 April 1903 by a group of Basque students at the Colegio de Ingenieros de Minas, Athletic Club de Madrid was an affiliated body of their parent club, Athletic Club de Bilbao. This arrangement continued until 1912, when it became a club in its own right. Early matches were played to the east of Madrid at a very basic ground called the Campo del Retiro. In 1913, the club moved to a location in central Madrid on the Calle de O'Donnell. This enclosure is often confused with that of Real Madrid's, who had opened their own ground a month earlier, which was fifty metres to the north east. Athletic's first match at the Calle O'Donnell was on 9 February 1913,  when the club lost to Athletic Club de Bilbao 0-4 in front of a crowd of 10,000. Here the club remained until May 1923, when it moved to the north west of Madrid and the Metropolitano.

(Nearing completion, the Estadio Metropolitano in early 1923)

The Estadio Metropolitano was built by the Urbanizadora Metropolitana, the forerunners of today's Madrid Metro as part of a real estate development close to the city's University. Architect José María Castell used the site of a natural amphitheatre, and at a cost of 1.5 million pesetas developed what would be largest and best stadium in the Spanish capital. The southern side featured an open area of seating that was accessed from the rear at street level. The eastern end behind the goal had a semi-circular terrace, which was also accessed at its rear. The northern side was made up of wooden bleachers, but was relatively slim as the land fell away quite sharply to the north west. The west end was left open, but further standing was provided on a cinder athletics track, which ran around the club's first grass pitch. Officially, the stadium had a capacity of 25,000, but accounts of the stadium's size vary greatly, in part to the additional standing provided on the athletics track, but also the large open grass banks the stood on either side and above the east terrace. This meant that crowds of 45,000 were not uncommon, and there are contemporary reports of as many as 75,000 attending fixtures.

(Pride of 1920's Madrid  – Estadio Metropolitano)

The stadium was inaugurated on 13 May 1923, when a crowd of 25,000 saw Athletic beat Real Sociedad by two goals to one. Whilst the home supporters were happy with the result, they and the local press were less than happy with the new stadium. Transport to the stadium was poor and when you arrived, access into the arena was congested. The Spanish Football Federation was also unhappy at the high cost of admission into the stadium, and whilst Athletic's matches continued to attract decent crowds, the stadium's other tenants, Racing Club de Madrid and Gimnastica Española struggled to attract an audience. Athletic and the Urbanizadora Metropolitana made a commitment to improve transport, access and facilities and by 1925 the stadium had a capacity of 30,000 and improved services. Four years later on 15 May 1929, 45,000 paid to watch the Spanish National Team inflict the first defeat on England by a continental side. The 4-3 victory was masterminded by the Spanish national coach, Fred Pentland, who happened to be English. Oh, the irony! Later that year, Athletic could not agree new terms with the owners and in September 1929 the club left the Metropolitano.

(Campo de Vallecas – Dodgy pitch even by 1930's standards)

Athletic started the 1929-30 season at Real Madrid's Charmatin stadium, and also played some home fixtures back in their old stamping ground of the Campo de Vallecas. They eventually returned to the Metropolitano in January of 1930, but the upheaval clearly did not help, and Athletic finished bottom of La Primera and was relegated. During the summer of 1930, the Urbanizadora Metropolitana carried out another upgrade to the stadium, building a covers over the southern and northern sides of the ground, but also converting the athletics track to allow greyhound racing. This didn't curry any favours with the Spanish Federation, who apparently outlawed the use of the stadium. So, Athletic returned to the east of Madrid and the Campo de Vallecas. The pitch at Vallecas was poor and over the next few seasons, the poor surface and disputes with the owners of the Metropolitano, saw the club criss-cross the capital, even playing matches back at Real Madrid's Chamartin. Athletic won promotion back to La Primera at the end of the 1933-34 season and played home matches during the 34-35 season at the Campo de Vallecas. The following season saw the club return to the Metropolitano, but this didn't inspire Athletic and a measly return of 15 points saw the club finish eleventh. However, relegation to La Segunda was the last thing on the club's mind when war broke out on the 17 July 1936.

(1939 & a decimated landscape with the Metropolitano at the centre)

The Civil War hit Athletic hard. Only six playing staff returned after the hostilities and the club had debts of over 1 million pesetas. To add to their woes, both the Campo de Vallecas and the Metropolitano had been destroyed. Drastic times call for drastic measures and in October 1939 the club merged with the air-force backed Aviación Nacional, to form Athletic-Aviación Club. Oviedo's inability to compete in the 39-40 La Primera threw the club a lifeline, and the Federation arranged a play-off between Athletic-Aviación and Osasuna for a place in that season's first division. Athletic-Aviación won the tie 3-1 and started the 39-40 season back at Real Madrid's Estadio Chamartin. Under the stewardship of the great Ricardo Zamora, Athletic-Aviación were a revelation and as the season progressed, both they and Sevilla battled for the league title. It came down to the final set of matches, with Athletic-Aviación's 2-0 win over Valencia at the renovated Campo de Vallecas earning them a first ever league title. The club retained its league title in 40-41 and during the summer, was forced to change to the Spanish version of their name, becoming Atlético–Aviación. During this period, work was under way on rebuilding the damaged Metropolitano. This included a new main stand, new terracing at the east end and for the first time, a substantial terrace on the north side of the ground. The Metropolitano was re-inaugurated on 21 February 1943 with a 2-1 victory over Real Madrid. Atlético were Madrid's top side throughout the 1940's and here's some footage of their 5-0 derby win from November 1947.

(Atlético dug deep and extended the stadium in 1954)

On the back of two further back to back title wins, Atlético finally purchased the Metropolitano on 15 April 1950 and immediately set about improving the facilities. The architect for the work was club president and former player, Javier Barroso. The first phase saw the terracing extended around to the west end and new changing facilities were built beneath this terrace. Then in the summer of 1954, the club took the audacious decision to excavate the pitch and add another ring of seating where the greyhound/athletics track had stood. This increased the official capacity to 58,000, but just when thoughts were turning to another period of success, their rivals from across the city upped the ante, winning nine of the next twelve league titles. Despite its recent refurbishment, the Estadio Metropolitano was already out of date, dwarfed by the newer, larger stadiums that Real Madrid and Barcelona had built. Thoughts were already turning to building a new stadium, when Atlético finally won the Copa in 1960 and made up for lost time with another success a year later. 

(Nearing the end. The Metropolitano in the mid-1960's)

In 1961, Atlético purchased large plot of land in the south western outskirts of Madrid, next to a gas works and on the banks of the Rio Manzanares. Work was slow, and with the Metropolitano sold and the club suffering financially, they moved in with Real Madrid for part of the 1964-65 season. They brokered an agreement to return to the Metropolitano for one final season in 1965-66 and gave the stadium a glorious send-off by winning La Primera. Here is some footage of the stadium in May 1965, when Atlético beat Real Madrid 4-0 in the last 16 of the Copa. Atléti played its last game at the old stadium on 8 May 1966, when they beat Athletic Club 1-0 in the first leg of the quarter final of the Copa del Generalisimo. The move south to their new stadium was  delayed until week 4 of the 1966-67 season, which given the upheavals of the previous 43 years, was not unexpected.

The black and white newsreel depicts catastrophe. A crowd parts, unsure of where to look as the two ashen-faced men carry out the dead body. It is barefoot, covered in a sheet, maybe a tablecloth. Though this footage is grainy and 50 years old, the bovine shock that hangs in the air is still palpable. In the rubble-strewn foreground, we see a tumult of helpers and mourners. In the distance, the exposed foundations of a tower block are visible, standing next to the crane that had erected it—which has now become a gallows. Like some cruel allegory, we are witnessing the dreams of one man, suspended in time, and the brutal realities that followed.

My father’s side of the family are ardent Atlético de Madrid fans. Growing up, it felt like Jesús Gil y Gil was almost one of us, a godfather, always present on the living room TV with a quotable quip, his face hanging from every newspaper kiosk like a grinning Baron Greenback. If you follow football, you’ve probably heard of him. If you’re into Spanish football, it’s a given. While mayor of Marbella, he infamously hosted a live TV show from a jacuzzi surrounded by bikini-clad women (with a national screen-share of 40%). Fidel Castro gifted him a crocodile which he named Fury and adorned with a gold chain. (He would later threaten to feed his Atlético players to it). And though he died in 2004, his funeral attended by 20,000, to this day, on the streets of Marbella, you will hear him spoken about very much in the present tense. “He’s in Brazil, on a beach somewhere…” For the average former second-hand car salesman, any of these exploits would amount to indicia of a life well-lived. For Gil, they are but mere anecdotes. He is one of those rare men: whatever you’ve heard is almost certainly true. But it’s the stuff you haven’t heard about that will make your eyes pop. 

 Gil was enormous in all senses, as though a thousand different luxuries and pleasures had snowballed into one man, glued together with corruption, forming a single gargantuan open-shirted, gold-chain-wearing, totem to naked ambition. Introducing him is an exigent task. Not because he’s a particularly complicated man to comprehend, at least on the surface, it’s more that there’s just so much of him—it’s hard to know where to begin. I’ll defer to the legendary Carlos Herrera who, in December 1995, on his eponymous talk show, described him thusly:
 “Tonight, we have a man that doesn’t stop talking… even when underwater. The Vatican is thinking of naming him the patron saint of referees. What hasn’t been said about him? Direct. Loudmouth. Effective. Without taboo. Brilliant. Unconscionable. He likes to stomp in puddles and he does this without any complex… He wins the favour of people as though he’s playing Monopoly. He’s triumphed in business, politics, and now, also football. He’s mayor of the city with more Rolls Royce-owners than anywhere on earth except London and he’s proprietor of a team that could challenge for the title this year. He is, Jesús Gil y Gil.” 

So emerged a mayor, a president, an owner—a man who would soon (if he wasn’t already) be looking libidinously towards the presidency of Spain itself. Gil stood there, his behemothic blazer hanging off his torso, as if someone had dressed a boulder in an expensive suit that morning, and, with a serpentiform smile, bathed himself in the réclame he loved so much.

Herrera’s first enquiry touched on his interviewee’s big break in business, doing up and flogging second-hand cars but Gil, as he so often did, viewed the question not as a blank to fill in, but as a trampoline from which to launch into another charismatic anecdote. “The truth is, I came to Madrid as a 17-year-old, thin as a skeleton. I moved into a brothel, I didn’t know it was a brothel, but the madam offered me the room for free if I kept her books. I was innocent, I was tender, I knew nothing. I was going to be a vet… But I left veterinary studies because when I saw a horse chucking up blood, I fainted. So, I took up economics instead.”

We’re left to ponder an improbable parallel universe wherein the tender Dr. Jesús Gil spent his life spaying and neutering pets. Spain would have been a very different place. Not just for Marbella and its skyline. Not just for Atlético Madrid, or club football in its entirety. Nor for the nation’s politics as a whole. But for the 58 people who died on the 15th of June, 1969. Luxury. Success. Defiance. Corruption. Fascism. Sex. Even death itself. All these elements orbited around Gil, sucked in by the gravitational pull of his charm, like so many planets in a solar system of avarice. He was a remarkable man, despite his protestations, a poster child for populism. Gil understood the value of masquerading in mediocrity and wore the mask of joe schmo convincingly, despite the axiomatic incongruity of being a wealthy property developer who owned a private jet, a pet crocodile and stables (he was fond of kissing his horses). “I’m not a saviour. I don’t condescend,” he said on June 15th 1991, the day he became mayor of Marbella. “I’m just one of you.” But what was he beneath the mask, beneath all that bluster?

On Jesús Gil’s Wikipedia page, his life is split into three categories Business, Politics, and Football (followed by death). While the lines between these three estates often blur in Spain, they stand neatly as the pillars in the life of Gil. “He understood that the mix of real estate development, plus politics, plus football, would be an explosive one,” said Carlos Castresana, the public prosecutor that would eventually put him in jail. But this realisation would come much later. For all the éclat of Gil’s later life, his story has far less conspicuous beginnings. 

 Gil was born on the 12th of March, 1933, in Burgo de Osma, a small, cobbled town quietly nestled around its 13th Century cathedral. Here he entered the world one week after the elections in Germany that would see Hitler effectively attain dictatorial powers, and three years before the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. But while he was born into a generation of upheaval, it was his mother, Guadalupe Gil Hernando, that would shape his destiny above all else. Born to labourers in a tiny village, she was known as La Guadalupe (The Guadalupe), a sturdy woman that lived to 91, dying two years before her son. In 1931, at the age of 19, she married one of the richest men in Burgo de Osma. Gerardo Gil Elvira had a business fixing potholes and laying roads by donkey. He was a widower, with three daughters, and 25 years her senior. Guadalupe would later tell Gil biographer and journalist Juan Luis Galiacho: “I admit I married for money. I never loved my husband. I would’ve married a dog or a cat.”

Within two years she would bear her first child, naming him Gregorio Jesús. Given that she happened to have the same surname as her husband —women in Spain do not take their husband’s name in marriage— custom would presuppose, therefore, her firstborn would be christened Gregorio Jesús Gil Gil. Yet Guadalupe would, perhaps rather portentously, eschew convention and pointedly introduce a single letter —y (and)— between her son’s identical surnames, as though two blue-blooded families had interlaced their illustriousness, a union of stately consequence. Her son would not just be the mere offspring of a road-layer from a sleepy cow-town. Nay, her son would be Gregorio Jesús Gil y Gil, someone of two eminent blood lines, someone who would go on to achieve things, someone who would matter. This single letter aspired, it reached for more, and in cognominating her son thusly, it was almost as if Guadalupe had predestined the boy to an entire lifetime of PR and puffery. Small-town gossip can be cruel and the particulars of Guadalupe’s biography are not widely known but in this one detail, we can, perhaps, begin to envisage the manner in which she came to be known as La Fanfarrona, The Braggart, a nickname her eldest son would go on to inherit. 

“His temperament, his insistence, his black marketeer mentality, that all came from his mother,” Galiacho told Vanity Fair. “Without her, [Jesús Gil] would have been less than zero. She was the one that created his persona of a businessman.”

Three children later and seven years after marrying her husband, she would have more than gossip to worry about. After a series of ill-informed business decisions, Gerardo Gil died in 1938. The little he bequeathed would be claimed by the three daughters from his first marriage, leaving Guadalupe, a widow at just 27, almost nothing with which to raise her three young children in the midst of a civil war. Jesús, then 5, would later recall a life lesson his mother gave him (in those hard days, one can imagine her whispering it just as much to herself): “Don’t let anyone step on you and have faith in yourself. Remember, you are a Gil.”

With her husband’s business now gone, La Guadalupe took out a loan of 25 pesetas and set up a tobacco kiosk in Burgo de Osma. It would soon become her command centre for a burgeoning black-market business. From there, she took over the town’s supply deliveries—wheat, salt, firewood—later seeing she could rent out the spare carts. Slowly, she grew her trade, eventually recovering her husband’s paving business. Franco’s fascistic Spain was in its infancy by now and new roads in good nick, as they do, took on political significance. Nascent regimes are ripe for clandestine kickbacks and it’s in this time that Guadalupe began to understand the bureaucratic ecosphere of local government. (I wonder, was her son watching?) She married again in 1942, already completely economically independent by then. “Just as with my previous husband,” she told Galiacho. “I never managed to love him.”

Fifty years later, on Carlos Herrera’s chat show, Jesús Gil would say of his mother: “I still have to call her three times a day because she thinks I’m still a little boy. She prays a lot. Lately, she prays now for Atleti. Same as my wife. But my mother, every day, she goes to twenty masses. Minimum. All the money I give her, she spends in church. But there’s no talking to her. And when I lose? She tells me: get rid of them!” 

With a chuckle, Carlos Herrera would clarify: “You mean she says you should get rid of the (Atlético de Madrid) manager, get rid of the players?” 

By then her son was riding high, having already won the mayorship of Marbella by a landslide four years before and was on the cusp of the crowning achievement of his career in football, winning the double with Atlético de Madrid in the 95-96 season. “Get rid of them all,” Gil replied, mimicking his mother with a sly grin. “They are tricking you.” 

When he married in 1961, La Guadalupe did not attend her son’s wedding and they went several months without speaking. According to Juan Luis Galiacho, this would be the only thing that would ever distance Gil from his mother. For someone who took two husbands but loved neither, perhaps it’s no surprise that she didn’t understand her son’s devotion to María de los Angeles Marín Cobo, a pretty green-eyed bakery clerk. “Guadalupe wanted her son to marry upwards,” Galiacho told Vanity Fair. “In an effort to scupper the romance, she sent an anonymous letter assuring her firstborn was lazy, dishonest, without two coins to rub together. A cousin wrote the letter but Guadalupe dictated the thing. Gil only had to read the first line to know who the real author had been. She always despised her daughter-in-law. That relationship never improved but eventually they became accustomed to living like that.”
 María Cobo would go on to tolerate almost every one of her husband’s antics, even when he would kiss his prized horse, Imperioso, during TV interviews. “Don’t worry, woman. I love you more than the horse,” he would wink. María would roll her eyes. “There is no difference between me and that horse.” More often than not, when asked for her opinion on her husband’s latest scandal, she would reply: “My husband talks enough for the both of us.”

Why exactly Guadalupe disliked María so decidedly isn’t known. Clearly, she held financial stability in matrimony above feeling. Maybe it was that she couldn’t accept her son had found something she hadn’t. That he had taken a different path. Or perhaps it was simply that Guadalupe never forgot the hardships in her own past, the wounds of surviving those days never healing. For all her son’s success, she knew how sharply fate turned—shark-fin quick. 

We’re left to wonder, then, if she foresaw how high her son’s star would climb (and fall) when he left Burgo de Osma as that tender 17-year-old, afraid of blood. Unlike his father, who had made his fortune thanks to the humble donkey, Gil vomited when having to practice on them. Did Guadalupe hold her head in her hands when he told her he no longer wanted to be a vet? Did she march straight to mass when he dropped out of economics too? Or maybe, given her moxie in bootleg markets, she responded positively to her son’s decision to get into the world of business? Whatever her take, it probably won’t come as much of a surprise that Gil’s first venture would entail cutting a few corners. Renting garages in the neighbourhood of Legazpi, and later Vallecas, today a hard-left-leaning working class area, (and home to one of the finest little football clubs in Spain), he would buy old vehicles, do them up, at least cosmetically, and flog them on. If the gears would grind, he’d pour sawdust to silence the problem. To quote Mickey O’Neil: you bought it like you saw it. In this way, Gil would soon be able to purchase his first apartment. He would later tell the story of making his first million and sleeping on a bed of his own money that night, like some second-rate Spanish Scrooge McDuck. 

Perhaps, born of a childhood of constant contretemps, he quickly developed a taste for the finer things in life. Good food. Expensive suits. Gold chains. Night clubs. Women. And how to woo them? At that time, it was said that he was driving one of three American convertibles in Spain—his was red (of course it was) and he called it The Meat Wagon (of course he did).  

By 1953, at the age of 20, Gil’s business had become a small empire. One imagines his innocence and tenderness turned to dust, replaced by street smarts inherited from his mother, sharpening his savvy with every deal he closed. Jesús Gil was making a name for himself. That he was doing well was beyond doubt. He could’ve stopped there. If wealth and success had been the goal, he had achieved that in a few short years, making his first million by 20, his métier straddling both cars and property. But at some point, as the Spanish say, it starts to fit a little small on him. It’s as if he goes to bed Jerry Lundegaard, and wakes up Gordon Gekko. What provoked this shift in weltanschauung is unclear. Perhaps it was a tête-à-tête with his mother. Or perhaps it was the motorbike accident he suffered in 1954 that disfigured his face and almost killed him. (Guadalupe would travel down from the village to the sanatorium, run by Carmelite nuns, and encourage the doctor there tending to Jesús Gil to give him the best possible medical attention thusly: If my son dies, I’ll take this knife in my bag and cut you open.) 

Whatever the cause of his epiphany, at some point Gil starts to think a little bigger than girls, cocktails, and flogging dodgy motors. Amid the hue and cry of a construction boom, he raised sufficient capital to speculate on land, buying around Madrid and its periphery. “His acquisition of Los Ángeles de San Rafael was a visionary move,” said Galiacho. It would be this move that would catapult him towards the persona that would be soon become, towards his great victories in politics and sport, and toward the tragedies that would inevitably follow.

An hour’s drive from Madrid, across mountains bestrewn with juniper groves of ibex and Pyrenean Oak forests watched over by imperial eagles, one reaches the plains of Old Castile. This land, characterised by medieval hamlets and rocky, sweeping panoramas, is likely best-known for Segovia, the beautiful provincial capital with its iconic Roman aqueduct. But it is also home to another, altogether less visited town. And it exists because of Jesús Gil y Gil. “I am, or at least I see myself, as a creator,” said Gil himself on television in 1968. “I want to create a city for 20,000 inhabitants. The aim is to bring the sea and the mountain together.” Luckily, the mountains were already in place, they didn’t have to be imported (though one feels Gil would have dreamt up some way). A ski station was built with chairlifts with service to the nearest mountain, La Mujer Muerta, so called for its shape which resembles a dead woman. The sea, however, was some 350km away to the north. Farther in all other directions. Gil, of course, had a plan. “We’ll have an exclusive reservoir so residents can practice nautical sport activities at our yacht club. It will be admired by all.” 

So it proved.

aqueduct-segovia-4197453_1920.jpg
“It was the city of his dreams,” said Gil’s son, Óscar Gil Marín on the HBO series The Pioneer (2019). “He wanted to build a reservoir, a dam, to create pharaonic projects… Imagine, he gets there and sees only rural land that has absolutely nothing but cows, located almost two or three hours from Madrid.” On the Los Ángeles de San Rafael website today, the promotional video shows a woman in a bikini drenched in a slow-motion torrent of water. There is a close-up of a red cocktail. Young people in good shape splashing each other in a pool. Even a horse is kissed. One imagines Jesús Gil would have approved. Feel. Live. New experiences. The video drips dynamism, selling a place of exhilaration, joie de vivre, the abandon of a summer holiday. Indeed, the town still boasts golf courses. Paintballing. A pirate-themed restaurant and a ‘multi-adventure centre’ advertising jet skis, 4x4s, and banana boats. The infrastructure for summer capers is all in place. There are also some grandiose architectural touches, hinting at its bombastic creator’s character, dotted haphazardly through town. Two stone angels holding swords guard the entrance. A vaguely Soviet bronze statue in homage to womankind crowns a roundabout. Yet it is also a distinctly ordinary place. On River Street, the Coming Soon posters outside the cinema are blank. Next door, the patio of a bar is almost full, its clientele, mostly of retirement age, enjoying libations on two converted parking spaces covered by a canopy, the awning advertising drains and gutters. Los Ángeles de San Rafael is a pleasant gated community, smartly middle-class in parts, hedges and stone walls along quiet avenues. Streets are all named, almost as an afterthought, for far away locations—Naples Street, Paraguay Street, France Avenue. It is home to some 12,000 people, yet it feels sparse somehow. A little lonely. From almost any angle, mountains and plains can be seen beyond. Wherever one stands, one might view outside. It’s hard to imagine that such a town could act as the path along which a man might follow his destiny to greatness. Or that, at the same time, it could be the greased slope descending to a ruinous calamity. For Gil, it was both. 

Despite this, if one looks for them, there are traces of him are everywhere in Los Ángeles de San Rafael. A small tile plaque on the foot of another vaguely Soviet concrete sculpture reads: To Jesús Gil y Gil, creator of this complex, where love meets the eternal. On the northern fringes of the town sits the Ciudad Deportiva Wanda, a sports centre where Atlético de Madrid establishes its summer training camp each year. (Gil would, of course, go on to become club president and later owner, while Wanda is the Chinese conglomerate that acquired naming rights to Atlético’s stadium in 2017). And on Venice Avenue, a bust of Gil sits in the centre of a rustic stone roundabout, kept company in the eternal by thriving lavender bushes, a slight smile molded into the ample bronze face. The inscription behind it reads: To Don Jesús Gil y Gil, for his excitement and passion, whose dream of a city is today a reality. Personally, it strikes me as strange that such a man could be held in reverence here, even if he did create the place—as though he were some sort of fertile yet vengeful god that must not be angered, else he taketh away.

 “He realised that Spaniards were starting to go on holiday,” said Gil’s younger brother, Javier Alfonso Gil. “To own a second residence. So he dreamt up a living complex. We went to Caja Segovia and Banco Hispanoamericano (former banks) asking for loans. He would project for them a reality. Look, he’d say. This is a reality. But it was absolutely only a utopia.”

The ‘Partial Plan’ for urbanization of the farmland known as El Carrascal was approved on the 28th of September, 1967. “He was already overseeing an enormous success,” continued Javier Alfonso. “He was selling lots of parcels and getting constant visits. Los Ángeles was starting to earn renown before the… problems that occurred. So, he starts hiring all the best artists. The best acts in Spain came to Los Ángeles on the weekends and people visited.” (Already, it seemed Gil understood the power of entertainment, something he would exploit to a massive extent, as though some crafty Caesar). “That was a golden epoch. He already had two restaurants but he wanted a new one, a bigger one—expand, expand, expand.”

On the 15th of June, 1969, Gil agreed a deal with food multinational SPAR to host a lunch and convention for some 300,000 pesetas (around £20,000 today). Given the high volume of SPAR employees (numbering in their hundreds), the lunch required the use of both the original restaurant and the new one, which was still under construction. Originally due to be completed at the end of July, Gil accelerated the schedule to mid-June, in time for his payday.

But by the morning of the convention, the cement had not yet set, and the mortar was still soft. Construction had taken place right up until the night before, the workers covering walls and partitions with tarps to hide unfinished areas. As a result, at 2:30pm, lunch would begin in a restaurant which had undergone no kind of official safety inspection whatsoever. Gil was in attendance initially, along with the deputy mayor of Segovia and the mayor of El Espinar. 150 people took their seats at several long tables, in an area of some 320 square metres. At 2:45 pm, everyone stood for the priest to bless the lunch. But there would be no blessing. The floor collapsed and the deck beams fell away, crushing a large number of people now below. “I remember June 15th well,” said Julio César Fernández, a journalist and former colleague of Gil (he had hired artists to perform in the town) and who was present in the restaurant. “When I arrived, people were already there. Whole families were there. It collapsed. When we fell down, until the first heads of survivors became visible, completely white, the silence was sepulchral. Silence. Not one cry. Nothing. Absolute silence… And then the mess began.”

The dead lay in piles, the wounded crying for help. Later, there would be reports of looting amid the Dantean carnage and screaming. It would be the cook, Nemesio Santos Meco, that would first inform Gil of the collapse who, at that moment, was in one of the urbanization offices. “I have an image of my father surrounded by a mass of people,” said his son, Jesús Gil Marín. “He was trying to give instructions on how to recover bodies.” Having being pulled from the rubble, Julio César Fernández recalls a less decisive figure. “When I was taken out of there, I found myself face to face with Jesús. He asked me do you think there are any dead? I recall my reply. Just go over there, have a look for yourself. And I never saw him again.”

It was the mayor of El Espinar, who had survived the collapse by virtue of sitting on the VIP table which was supported by independent pillars, that gave notice to Adolfo Suárez, the then Civil Governor of Segovia. Suárez had only been in the role for a year and would go on to become the first President of Spanish democracy after the death of Franco. But in 1969, arriving at Los Ángeles, he could scarcely believe his eyes. Exactly what happened next is not known but some kind of fight or tussle broke out between Suárez and Gil leading to the latter being locked in a room under custody of the notorious Civil Guard. Perhaps due to the fight, or perhaps for fear of Gil being lynched. Either way, the two would never bury the hatchet.

In the following days, as the number of dead increased, Jesús Gil (and several colleagues), appeared in court. Before the Magistrate, Gil took responsibility for the compensation that would be due to the victims and their families but refused to acknowledge his guilt. He never would. During proceedings, it came to light that Gil had failed to request the necessary certificate for the expansion of the restaurant from the local hospitality union. Nor had he requested the necessary permit from the Ministry of Tourism. Nor had he requested approval relating to electricals from Segovia’s Delegation of Industry (electricals which had not, at any rate, even been installed). “He was not responsible [for the collapse],” said his son, Óscar Gil Marín. “It just came upon him. It’s like a plane accident. I don’t think, back then, my father knew the construction risks.” Despite this claim, during the court case, a letter was given into evidence from his surveyor, José María del Pozo Cubero, who wrote the following to Gil: 

To take this seriously, you must hire an architect who analyses the structure and then reviews the work that is being carried out, so that he takes responsibility for it, [in order to avoid], when construction of a party room or restaurant is carried out, that some misfortune could happen. There is still time to repair this. You shouldn’t handle this project yourself. I can no longer act as your surveyor and, as consequence, no longer run this project.

The letter would exonerate del Pozo. Gil, having ignored the warning, (and others, such as from Segovia’s School of Architecture) was not spared. He was sentenced to five years in prison and obliged to pay a fortune in compensation to the victims and their families. It was one Francoism’s biggest catastrophes. For a man who’d made his first million at 20, Gil had risked it all for the sake of a few thousand pesetas and now almost 60 people were dead. Why he’d roll the dice when he was busy selling land and, presumably, earning far more significant sums, is hard to understand. Maybe those big loans necessitated swift repayment. Or perhaps cutting corners was simply baked into the cake. It had worked for him so far. But cut enough corners and, sooner or later, your house falls down. Los Ángeles de San Rafael was less than two years old on the day of the tragedy. Gil had achieved his dream and built a town. It had been the admiration of all. For a short while, at least. But that dream became a nightmare. As for that compulsion to expand, expand, expand? It was now confined to a 3x4-metre cell.

Gil entered Segovia’s jail in 1971. Decades later, he would recall his time in the clink with the legendary Jesus Quintero—you may have seen him losing his professional cool in the laughing man meme that went around the world (the original, incidentally, is far funnier than any of the spoofs that have been made). “What’s jail good for?” Quintero would ask. 
 “Jail is good for nothing,” Gil replied. “It’s a warehouse of human beings where you only create more delinquents.” 
 Quintero stayed on the topic. “Were you a leader in jail?” 
 Gil responded unflinchingly. “I’ve always been a leader.” 

As with Carlos Herrera some years earlier, these succinct questions were met with sprawling, Cervantean answers. Gil didn’t do ripostes, he told stories. “I’ll tell you, the first time I was in jail—I’ll tell you a grave matter—it was for nine months after the collapse in Los Ángeles de San Rafael. It wasn’t my fault or anything but okay. So, a lot of people died. I had to go buying off corpse after corpse. It’s very harsh to say it like that. At first, they [the families of the victims] don’t want to hear it. Afterwards, it becomes how much? After that, it becomes no, that’s not enough. So anyway, in jail I was in with the lazy and the crooks. Those are the inmates I was with. One guy had raped a little girl but the mother had consented to it. Another guy was told by his wife that he had a better time with the donkey and the pig than with her. So, look. Spain has these people too, we shouldn’t close our eyes.” Quintero nodded indifferently at yet another peregrination, then checked his notes, about to ask another question. But Gil, as he so often did, launched into another anecdote in order to keep his audience’s attention. “We suffered terribly with the cold in jail. You couldn’t stop it with boots or coats or, that cold would get into your bones and you would die. So, I had to make an agreement with the priest. I said to him, there’s 80 of us. If you want us to go to mass, you let me run things on the inside. You bring us firewood and a stove, and every one of us will congregate. And God forgive us, we all went. Now look, I’m a Catholic. Maybe I don’t practise much but I’m the one who’s made the most churches in Spain. I’m up to nine churches. Go and ask the bishop in Malaga, you’ll see. Because I’m a believer and that. So, yeah, [in jail] we all went to congregate like little lambs, the priest couldn’t believe it. The first day, he didn’t have enough communion wafers. We had to split them four ways.” Quintero, shaking his head, had to suppress his laughter. 

Gil had painted a picture of hardship in prison where he was forced to survive on his wits, surrounded by zoophiles and pederasts, making deals to warm the bones of inmates, all the while bringing them closer to God. Better the sinner that repenteth and all that. But was it true?

“Life in prison wasn’t hard for Gil. They set up an office for him, he played cards with the guards,” said Juan Luis Galiacho. As he wrote in El Cierre Digital: “He turned his cell, with a typewriter and carpet included, into an office serving as a branch of his business, a business that he did not intend to abandon. Thus, from prison he continued to hire workers and direct the running of the Los Ángeles de San Rafael complex.” Jesús Gil Marín, his eldest son, also derogates the Count of Monte Cristo story of bread and water, telling HBO: “At that time, Cándido was the best restaurant in Segovia and they brought meals to my father in jail every single day.” Inside, Gil became a foreman of sorts, divvying up wine, tobacco, coffee, and quickly establishing himself as a popular figure. These freedoms meant that Gil was able to organise meetings with prisoners and officials. “At siesta time,” wrote Galiacho in El Cierre Digital. “When the other inmates were confined to their cells, Gil gathered his guests in his ‘dining room’ and doled out seafood and roasts. It was how he kept the prison under control.”

But while Gil occupied himself in the slammer with the running of his business and ensuring the body of Christ passed the lips of his fellow inmates each week, his mother was on a very different mission. Though Gil had only been sentenced to (an exceedingly lenient) five years for reckless negligence, this punishment was unacceptable to La Guadalupe. Her philosophy in life was don’t let anyone step on you and she felt that the state had very much stepped on her son. She would meet with Pilar Franco, sister of the dictator. She would meet with a cardinal and archbishop of Madrid. Several ministers. Her grovelling letters were received at the highest echelons of Spanish power. As far as she was concerned, to quote John Turturro’s show-stealing cameo in The Big Lebowski: “Nobody fucks with The Jesus.” In February 1972, just under two years before being spectacularly smoked by ETA, Franco’s right-hand man and president of the government, Luis Carrero Blanco pardoned Jesús Gil y Gil. He had served only four months, less than a month for every fourteen people that lost their lives in his restaurant. “She is the one that saved him always,” Juan Luis Galiacho told Vanity Fair.

But free or not, his name was in ruins. Not to mention, he owed millions in victim compensation. What Jesús Gil needed now was a way to wash his reputation clean. What he needed now was a way to make a lot of money and fast. What he needed was a mug’s game. What he needed was football.

Fire up the time machine and set the dial to November 23rd, 1996. Specifically, the 32nd minute of the premier league encounter between Southampton and Leeds United at The Dell. Picture the scene, midfield virtuoso Matthew Le Tissier has just gone off injured. Enter Ali Dia (real name Aly Dia), Senegalese international, former PSG player, and cousin of George Weah, wearing the number 33 shirt. He’s making his debut today but nobody has heard of him—is he any good? Why, former World Player of the Year (and future president of Liberia) George Weah vouched for him personally, even telephoning Southampton manager (and future Sky Sports pundit/casual xenophobe) Graeme Souness. He must be half decent. By the 85th minute, Dia’s debut was cut short, ignominiously being subbed off, and the Southampton faithful had their answer. Though he had been on the pitch for only 53 minutes, two things were clear by that point. 1) if Ali Dia did share DNA with George Weah, he certainly shared none of his talent. Le Tissier would later describe the debut as: Fucking hopeless. Embarrassing, like Bambi on ice. And 2) while Weah may have been a marvellous player, if he had vouched for Dia, a future career as a scout looked improbable. 




It transpired, of course, that Weah had never heard of Ali Dia and that it had, in fact, been a classmate of Dia’s that had phoned Souness. On that winter afternoon, Southampton fans had been left bemused, wondering, how could this have happened? Souness had played for Sampdoria, managed in Turkey. ‘Ulubatli’ had contacts. Continental savvy. How could he have been mugged off like this by a simple phone call? Reader, had they access to our time machine, they would have been all the more puzzled, given the Scot’s self-avouched knowledge of foreign cultures, that his great perspicacity, sadly, did not extend to the African. 

 

While there is a harmless pleasure in this story, it’s simple enough to understand. A classic con job. A Senegalese Mrs. Doubtfire with brass balls and a funny way of running. But what if the con had been an inside job? I’ll explain. Now, most football fans have heard of the Dia debacle, it’s all but legend. Yet I’ll warrant most won’t have heard of the other Senegalese to have signed for a leading European football club in the 90s without anyone knowing if he could actually play football. Limamou Mbengue did just that, joining Atlético de Madrid on January 16th, 1998. Just as those Southampton supporters two years prior, fans of Los Colchoneros (meaning mattress-makers, for the leftover fabric from which the wives of the factory workers made the club’s first kits) were left scratching their heads: who the hell is this guy? Reader, with our time machine, we will come back to Mbengue in the third and final part of NOBODY F**KS WITH THE JESÚS but for now let’s stay in 1998. For there was hardly time to process the news. After all, he wasn’t the only incoming transfer. Atleti had also signed a Nigerian, Abass Muyiwa Lawal. Along with Bernado Matías Djana, from Angola. And not forgetting, of course, Maximiliano de Oliveira Teixeira, a Brazilian, and the cousin of Denilson’s chauffeur’s mum’s neighbour’s adopted son. (OK, that last bit isn’t true). Football hipsters did not yet exist, but if they did, not even the biggest tash-twirling Swiss Raiffeisen Super League-viewing hipster would have heard of these guys. Nobody had heard of them. They were essentially real-life Football Manager regens. From where did Atleti sign them? Why, from Promociones Futbolísticas, of course. And no, that’s not a third-division team in Bolivia, it was a private company that Jesús Gil had set up. What does that mean? Well, it means he owned the players privately. As in, they belonged to him. And he had just sold them to the football club of which he happened to be president. Jesús Gil passed four objects from his left hand to his right hand and charged money for doing so. Some €15 million, in fact, an astronomical figure at the time. The only catch? They weren’t actual footballers. In the case of Mbengue, he was a refugee living in Spain having claimed asylum. In effect, the president of Atlético de Madrid had gone and done an Ali Dia on his own club. And if you thought that was bad form from a club president, well, amigos, as The Bobbettes so wonderfully sang, You Ain’t Seen Nothin’ Yet.

In Part 1 of NOBODY F**KS WITH THE JESUS, I delved into the humble beginnings of Jesús Gil y Gil—from childhood poverty, to failed veterinary student, to wheeler dealer in second-hand cars, before rising to power as a property magnate—until falling from grace as a convicted criminal. 

Last time we left off with Gil freshly released from jail after going down for a few months having been found guilty of mass manslaughter (his substandard construction of a restaurant had resulted in the deaths of 58 people in 1969). For many, that would have been the end of their story, the shame enough to cause them to quietly slink into obscurity, not wanting to bother the pages of the history books ever again. But not Gil. For one thing, he wasn’t made that way. He was simply too recalcitrantly flamboyant for that. For another, while he had been released from his jail sentence early, Gil was still legally obliged to pay millions in compensation. And he only had the one way of doing that. Selling parcels of land in the town that he built, Los Ángeles de San Rafael. 

 

Just one problem. It was the very scene of the tragedy that had landed him in jail in the first place. Buying a plot of land on which to build your dream home in a Gil’s utopia circa 1971 would have been about as appealing as an off-cuts match day beef burger in the middle of the vCJD outbreak. Perhaps, in these dark days, Gil recalled an old solution to an old problem. When the gears of the second-hand motor he was trying to flog were grinding, he knew how to add oil to silence them. Now that oil would be reinvention. Gil understood that it wasn’t just Los Ángeles that required metamorphosis. He did too. And so, with little other option, he pulled up his (considerable) trousers and got stuck into a PR-rebranding. And how to start fixing the cosmetics of his tragic town? As an old man in a bar in Madrid once told me: Listen, Spaniards love three things above all. Football and tits. It was a philosophy Gil took as gospel. Like his spiritual scion Donald Trump would some years later, he would host Ms. Universe contests on his property. Miss Spain pageants. And just as he had done before the tragedy, he would hold music concerts, the latest pop craze (within the bounds of Franco’s strict censorship laws, of course) drawing crowds from far and wide to little old Los Ángeles de San Rafael. Even the great Rinus Michels would bring his Barcelona side to stay in Gil’s properties, locals agog at the sight of the legendary pair of Johans, Cruyff and Neeskens. If Gil understood nothing else, he had always grasped that entertainment can breed legitimacy. And in Spain, there is, of course, no greater and more profoundly beloved entertainment than football. 

 

When he discovered that Vicente Calderón, revered Atlético de Madrid president (the stadium was renamed in his honour), was bringing the team to nearby Segovia for pre-season training, Gil went on a charm offensive. We’re left to wonder what kind of stops he pulled out to do this but one thing is certain, they would become firm friends. (To this day, Atleti still undertakes pre-season physical training in Los Ángeles de San Rafael). 

 

Gil knew football was Spain’s opiate of choice. If he could somehow finagle his way into Atlético de Madrid, not only would it be good PR, it would be good money. Here was a man with debts. Here was a man that craved power. And suddenly, here was a man with an idea: what if football wasn’t just a bit of grass with a bunch of blokes running around on it? What if you could dig beneath it? And what if you would find there was pay dirt. But befriending the president of one of Spain’s most successful football clubs was one thing. Replacing him was another. Particularly if you knew nothing about football. Then again, that hadn’t stopped Gil selling cars. Or selling land. Or selling pipe dreams to banks telling them all the while it was reality in exchange for huge loans. Still, it begs the question: how in the eff did he manage it?

“My father didn’t understand anything about football,” Miguel Ángel Gil Marín would tell HBO. “In fact, I think he died without understanding football.” That may be true, but what Gil did understand was how to charm people. As his youngest son, Óscar Gil Marín, would say: “Football was the platform he chose on which to reinvent himself and make himself known.” Gil himself, wearing a purple silk scarf, a gold pocket watch, and flanked by ebony statues of cranes and naked women, explained his ingratiation process very simply during an interview. “I started speaking with Don Vicente Calderón, anyway, after that, I joined the board and I was only there four months. That’s how long I lasted because I didn’t like it, the traditional system back then was… different. The majority were on the board for personal profit and gain from the club. That’s why clubs have such huge debts.” As such, Gil, remarkably, has the bright idea (and the bollocks) to present himself as the anti-corruption candidate. He stood against the excesses and rackets present in football. “This is exactly the same thing he would do later when running for Mayor in Marbella,” says Gil biographer and journalist Juan Luis Galiacho. “It’s always the same with him you see, he’s very repetitive in all of his little ways. But Calderón believes in him. He thinks that Gil is the only one capable of saving Atlético de Madrid from the dramatic financial situation it was in. That’s when the elections for the club presidency are announced.” 

 

It was 1987, and a handful of solid candidates presented themselves for the presidency of Atlético de Madrid. Among them, Enrique Sánchez de León, a solid and clear-sighted candidate, a man that had been in cabinet as Minister of Health and Welfare. “Gil? It’s a difficult mystery to explain,” he told HBO’s The Pioneer (2019). “How does a delinquent become a charismatic leader of a collective? I was a serious and boring candidate. People knew me through politics. And I tabled [for the club] a realistic panorama. But the attractive candidate was Gil. His personality overflowed. He created compelling fictions. He was someone that every single day would aliment the press, he created controversy.” Galiacho would underscore the important role the press played in Gil’s victory. “He gains the support of the media, particularly (renowned sports journalist) José María García, they all support him. José María García was a god back then, there wasn’t a single Spaniard that didn’t listen to him. Me included.” As for poor old boring Enrique Sánchez de León? Well, José María García himself explained it. “Look, he was a good bloke. Intelligent. Well-prepared. In those things, he had the advantage. But he was boring. Flavourless. Now, he respected the law exquisitely. The thing is, football back then? It was a world without laws. And the momentum was with Gil.” (It didn’t hurt, of course, that García had Gil on the radio all day long). Sánchez de León went from being the clear favourite, a noble, elegant steed out in front of the peloton, to feeling the sour breath on his croup of a donkey catching a second wind. What’s more, Gil had a plan. Once again, he would bet on artifice over art. He was selling another dodgy motor, this time to all of Spain. He needed a big sodding dollop of oil to quiet the grinding gears. He needed a cosmetic WMD. And he had just the man for the job. It was a tactic that Florentino Pérez would copy years later at Real Madrid when nicking Figo from their eternal rivals. “Atlético needs a game-changer,” Gil would say. “And you can count on one hand how many of those there are in the world today. Van Basten at Milan, and so and so over there, and so and so over there (y tal y tal, meaning so and so, was Gil’s catchphrase, and it would later become the title of his TV show—more on that anon). Who’s the true star right now? It’s Futre, who is 21.”

Handsome, talented, and lightning fast, the young olive-eyed winger had just won the 1986-87 European Cup, putting in a man of the match performance in the final against Bayern Munich. He’d already won two league titles. The world was at his feet. So, how to convince Paulo Futre to sign for Atleti? Just as he had sweet-talked banks into granting him vast loans to build his as yet non-existent utopia, and just as he had convinced Vicente Calderón into moving his pre-season to said utopia before charming his way into inheriting the presidency, Gil went on a PR offensive. He donned his aviators, took a private jet, and flew out to Milan. Gil recounted the story to national Portuguese broadcaster, RTP. “We went to a private hotel in Milan because we had bought the rights to Futre, and now we had to actually talk with him! So, I saw the Porto players in the lobby of the hotel. I looked down at their shoes and I noticed, on one of them, the name Futre was written. I said, so this one is Futre.” To this day, the Portuguese recalls the meeting. “He was a big, strong man with gold chains. I’ll never forget that moment. The meeting was incredible. Everything we asked for, he accepted. I would say, I want X, and he would say OK. Then he would add, what about a house? And I said, hm, a house? OK. And he said, no problem, with a pool. Car? He was asking me! So, I replied. Uh, Porsche? And him, OK, Porsche.” 



Futre became more than a star signing to Gil. He would become club captain for much of his time at Atleti and, as many have noted, including Gil’s own children, Futre was more like a son to Gil. “My dad’s dream was to present Futre in Jacara nightclub and to do these elections his way.” With Futre in tow, now driving a dealership-new Porsche, Gil won the presidency by a landslide. The mayor of Los Ángeles was now a football president. “I was saddened to see how easily the masses were won over,” said Enrique Sánchez de León. “Good, innocent people, lapping up demagogic, unrealistic ideas. Well, that’s populism, no? All that matters here is Futre and beating Real Madrid.” In a packed stadium, the players would take to the field, Futre now among them wearing the number 10 shirt, to bathe in the applause of the overjoyed fans. And Gil, as ever, would have something to say about it. “We’re going after every trophy! Atlético de Madrid has changed, it has somebody to defend it now,” Gil then told perhaps the greatest of all his lies, wrapped up in a distorted truth. “Also, from now on, you can be sure that we won’t do crazy things. Every peseta paid out, won’t be paid, unless signed off by me.” 



And in the beginning, those pesetas rushed out of Atleti like a great dam giving way. Gil hadn’t just signed Futre. In the first week, he also brought in Marcos (father of Chelsea’s Marcos Alonso), Eusebio Bejarano, and even World Cup-winning manager César Luis Menotti. In one of those wonderful quirks of fate, he also signed the menacing and vaguely simian-looking Andoni Goikoetxea, The Butcher of Bilbao, who infamously framed the boots he wore on the day he broke Maradona’s ankle. Menotti, Barcelona manager at the time, was left incensed, and it would cement a rivalry with Bilbao manager and polar opposite Javier Clemente for years to come. For Jesús Gil, signings players would rarely be much of an issue. Across 17 years as club president, he would bring in 166 of them, almost a whopping 10 per season. He wasn’t shy about hiring and firing managers either. By the end of his presidency, his total stood at 39. Some seasons were crazier than others. 1993, for example, saw him go through no less than five. In the end, it works out to over two managers a season—not exactly ideal when you’ve promised we won’t do crazy things. “His great failing as a president,” said Paulo Futre. “Was his lack of patience. Defeat just wouldn’t enter into his head. If you lost twice and drew once, that was it, curtains. You’re fired. And he would sack the manger. It was terrible. It was terrible in the dressing room.” The ever-eloquent Menotti, following his inevitable sacking by Gil in March of 1988, would describe the man as “just a brute copy of Capone.” His successor didn’t have much more luck. And by January of 1989, Marca’s headline would read: THAT’S 3. Ron Atkinson would tell the same newspaper: I don’t know anything officially, but I bet he’s given me the boot. February 1990 rolled around and the headline in El Mundo Deportivo read thusly: GIL AXES CLEMENTE. “For me,” Gil famously said on the topic. “Sacking a coach is like having a beer, I could sack 20 in a year. Or 100, if needs be.”

But it wasn’t just his stance on managerial appointments that was being noticed. It wouldn’t take long for Gil’s financial abnormalities to catch up with him. As early as May 1989, national newspaper ABC went with the headline: GIL’S FINANCIAL IMBROGLIOS ARE REVEALED AT ATLÉTICO. But revealed or not, it wouldn’t be enough to put the breakers on Gil’s outside-of-the box thinking when it came to financial imbroglios. During the 1990-91 season, Gil unveiled his latest masterstroke: Atleti’s new club sponsor would be the city of Marbella itself. A town of which, in the summer of 1991, he himself would become mayor. And that single word, MARBELLA, would infamously run across the chests of the players for the next few seasons. “It seemed almost like an act of charity, no?” said councillor Isabel García Marcos (more on her later). “But it stood out. It made you think: Gil has done this for free? He doesn’t do anything for free.” Just as Gil had used music and Miss Universe to flog his real estate up in the mountains, now he was using Atleti to do the same for Marbella.

At any rate, up until now, Gil had talked a good game. He’d brought in players. And he’d kept his promises to the fans (or so it seemed). Except for the one about going for all the trophies. 1991 would be the year that changed. On top of becoming mayor of Marbella, his team finally brought home some silverware. The Copa del Rey final was a dogged affair. Alfredo Santaelena scored four goals during his Atleti career but one of them will live forever. In the 111th minute, he notched the only goal of the game. Tears welling in his eyes, Gil would recline in his seat and cover his mouth with the emotion. “Another dream come true for him,” says Paulo Futre. “Everything was possible with this man.” Futre himself handed Gil the cup, as if repaying the paternal faith he had reposed in the Portuguese, a son coming home with straight A’s. Gil, standing in the director’s box, lifted the massive trophy almost one-handed and smiled for the crowd that he had delivered for. “Gil quickly now sees it,” says Galiacho. “Now he’s not the marginalised one anymore, he’s not stigmatised by the tragedy of Los Ángeles de San Rafael that had plagued him for so long. No, he’s the new god.”

It seems somewhat more normal today; a businessman not just suddenly donning the hat of a politician, but running for public office and, despite having no relevant qualifications or experience whatsoever, somehow, emerging victorious. Up until 1991, that had never been seen before in Spain. But what made Gil think he was cut out for politics? (Other than being a black belt in Machiavellian dealings, of course). He himself, answered that question many times. But his answers, as they so often were, would always be tailored to the audience. Helping his fellow man, trying to right wrongs, believing in the general spirit of human advancement, pick a card, really. But it’s hard to ignore the word ‘opportunity’ when it comes to Gil’s every move. Or, perhaps it was simply that the sweet taste of victory in 1987 with Atleti had given him an appetite for elections. That warm rush of acceptance, the people have spoken and they have chosen me. It’s easy to imagine Gil wanting more of that. And it’s a given that he wanted more money. But he must have known that, after enjoying a landslide in Madrid, he would be playing on an altogether more complex pitch against trickier opposition. And in politics, it would take more than a Portuguese winger with green eyes to win over voters. Yet the methods he had applied to his earlier successes were still bankable for Gil. That great victory meant that, whereas he had always understood the value in PR and selling an idea, now he grasped the true power of appealing to populism. If you gave the people what they wanted, however unconventional or base, they would love you for it. And so, it was a philosophy that he would export to his political candidacy for the mayorship of Marbella just four years after Futre. But his opponent this time around could not have been more different to Enrique Sánchez de León: a young, attractive blonde socialist, Isabel García Marcos wasn’t afraid of saying what she thought to Gil’s face (he, in turn, would call her a whore to hers during council meetings). Many years later, talking to HBO, she would acknowledge the man’s star power. “Many would have liked to have been like him. He was a bit of an idol to many. We can’t deny the truth. When he was well into his term, suspicions that he was a thief would arise. But the people would say: I don’t care, they’re all the same. At least this guy actually does things for us. It’s terrible. But people thought that it was true.” Those trademark bombastic shows of flamboyant wealth and unapologetic appeals to lowbrow populism did not go away. Gil merely transferred them southwards along with his new far-right political platform: Grupo Independiente Liberal. Or just, GIL. (And yes, really).

Marbella Town Hall
Marbella Town Hall

In the end, Gil won the race for the Town Hall by a landslide. One of his first acts as mayor was to, repugnantly, install a bust of Franco in the town hall—as if to signify a new way of governance, one that required only the decisions of a single man. He was in the habit of strolling through Marbella insulting any homeless people or sex workers (despite secretly paying them off for their exile). His police force, some of which was made up by elite military legionnaires recruited from postings in Northern Africa, were told to be tough on crime. “When I came to Marbella, it was like the Wild West,” Gil told veteran interviewer, Jesús Quintero. “But I have the best police force in Spain. They’re sensational because they fight. Just to fuck with people, I’ve bought them Harley Davidsons. Tourists take photos. Look, it’s no point of pride, but according to the prosecutor, these delinquents today say, with this son of a whore Gil, you can’t even GO to Marbella anymore.” As stated, Gil was tough on crime. Depending on what sort of crime one meant by ‘crime.’ Not so much on British or Russian gangsters, however. Marbella infamously became a haven for them. Not to mention, heavy hitters in the world of evil subhumanity such as Otto Remer and Léon Degrelle, who would happily swerve extradition and elude any kind of justice for their war crimes as Nazis. And yet, all the while, Gil would push for crackdowns on back alley drug users, sex workers, and foreigners. Civil liberties? Those got in the way of improving the quality of life in his town. Unsurprisingly, by the time of Gil’s death, corruption was so deep-rooted in the Marbella council that it had to be dissolved. Though it was a move common in Italy when dealing with Mafia-infiltrated municipalities, it had never been done in the history of Spain. Another first in Gilismo. And, who could forget, the TV show he hosted on Telecinco, live from a jacuzzi surrounded by young women in swimwear, The Nights of So and So. (Imagine the lovechild of Babestation and TFI Fridays if produced by Paul Nuttall). In short, there was nothing quite like it on TV. José María García, who unsurprisingly became Gil’s lifelong friend, recalled on HBO: “One day [after seeing him on TV] I said to him: Jesús, you beast. What are you doing with five birds in a hot tub? And he said to me: friend, I am selling Marbella.” It was, essentially, a live variety show with Gil at its heart. There might be some kids breakdancing, or you might see Benny Hill getting slapped in the face by Gil, but that was the fluff. The main feature was the Q&A where people around Marbella could ask the great man questions directly. One elderly gentleman asked: what would you do if you found out your son was a faggot? Gil replied with a characteristic mix of the reprehensible and the reasonable: “Man, I think it’s a bit weird, personally. I mean being with a bloke in bed and, uh, looking at him and all that? No. I think it’s a bit weird. But when it comes down to it, in the end, I think above all you have to respect it. If my son were a faggot. Or my daughter a lesbian. Or a prostitute. I would help them always. And respect them always. And always be their friend.” (This sentiment clashed somewhat with his own football transfer policy: once I was going to sign an important player and then I found out he was a faggot and I thought, no, that one can’t go in my team changing room). Whether it was the pearls of wisdom, the slapstick, or just the tits, Las Noches de Tal y Tal pulled in a national screen-share of 40%. Of course, it would later transpire that Marbella city functionaries would be waiting near the jacuzzi, off-camera, for Gil to sign official documents. How could such an absurd situation arise? Perhaps because this man had grown accustomed to people carrying out his every word, no matter how ridiculous or egregious. Another one of his many talents: making the unreasonable sound eminently reasonable.

 

By now, Gil was known throughout all of Spain. People were talking about Gil. One imagines he hadn’t conceived of the idea of a live TV show with wisdom and wabs just for the lark of it. What he wanted was exposure. That would lead to expansion. And it worked. His political vehicle, Grupo GIL, not only allowed him to talk about himself in the third person, it was getting stronger. Spreading throughout the coast, he sent his acolytes and children (sound familiar?) in his stead to represent his brand of his bawdy ‘common sense’ xenophobia — going back to basics with pyrotechnics and open bars. And he wasn’t just limiting himself to mainland Spain. Gil would later blame his downfall on State persecution triggered by this expansion. For he had set his seedy sights on Ceuta and Melilla, Spanish territories in Northern Africa, planning to turn them into a Mediterranean ‘Hong Kong’ with floating casinos and effective control of shipping and tourism routes towards the Caribbean and beyond. This was not only stepping on toes of national security. It felt like a first move towards a higher office, above football, and above Marbella. What if Gil was, whisper it, thinking of running for the presidency of Spain itself? We’ll never know how he would have fared in a such a complex political kaleidoscope as the general elections in Spain. Though he was two for two back then, it was never to be. (And, frankly, thank f**k for that).

 

But back to his interview with Jesús Quintero. When asked the question, but who votes for you, Gil was uncharacteristically pithy. “Everyone votes for me. Because they want well-being. They want their livelihoods looked after.” He wasn’t wrong. Grupo GIL was re-elected three times. Reader, you must have realised by now that Gil cut corners and thumbed his nose at regulation every step of the way. Quelle surprise then, eh, to learn that he didn’t stop once he had been elected to public office. As sure as mercury runs into mercury, corruption runs into success. And that corruption still stands today, the white, denticulate punctuation of his apartments against the Marbella skyline, like some ageing movie star’s unnaturally shiny teeth. 

But why Marbella in the first place? The truth was, Gil hadn’t just appeared overnight. It wasn’t civics that had attracted him, it was making money. He’d been present in the city long before 1991, forever trying to erect his luxury structures, like a frenzied spider. In the mid-1980s, in the thick of a slipshod real estate boom wherein banks would supply more financing than was strictly necessary, time and again, Gil found himself falling foul of city planning regulation. On the 14th of August 1987, the headline in the newspaper Diario Sur would read: MARBELLA COUNCIL SEEKS THE PARALYSIS OF JESÚS GIL CONSTRUCTION WORKS. Despite lacking the permits, he would continue building, defying first the mayor who ordered him to desist, and then a judge. Six weeks later, the headline in the abovesaid newspaper ran thusly: JESÚS GIL DENIED NEW BUILDING PERMIT IN MARBELLA. “This structure is the beginning of the Gil era here,” said Alejandro Dogan, vice president of the Residents Association of Marbella on Antenna 3 in 2019. He was gesturing towards a large, white luxury apartment complex—with its tiers and glass atrium and porthole windows, it looks more like a cruise ship. “Gil began the construction of this building but he was not given the permits by the city authority and they halted it. Okay, he thought, if the local council has stopped my construction, how can I obtain the permits? Very simple, I’ll become mayor, and that way I’ll give myself the permit. Of course, after that he began to realise what a gold mine this town was. That is to say, if you were willing to bend the rules a bit, your feet only had to touch the ground here and you would find money under the very stones. And that’s exactly what he did.” Whenever Gil came up against a regulation that inconvenienced him, like the eighth of so many Henries, he would ask: but why does it have to be that way? “First off, he realises that these rejections are relative,” said his opponent in the 1991 mayoral elections, Isabel García Marcos. “Then he realises that by bribing certain public officials, what ‘cannot be done’ suddenly transforms into what can be done. When problems arose, he thought: how do I make this go away? Well, I pay. He’s given the permits and those buildings are still standing there today.” As Gil’s deputy mayor, Antonio Sampietro, pointed out. “Nobody stopped it [Gil’s building projects], no-one said that permit is incorrect. Why? Because everyone, everyone, everyone had a lot to keep quiet about.” When asked about these bribes in an interview, Gil dismissed the notion. Sitting before two (presumably) Ming dynasty vases in his home, wearing a khaki safari shirt open almost to the abdomen, and his neck and wrist resplendent in gold which glared in the hazy grain of the 80s soft focus camera, he reasoned: “There isn’t a developer out there that has built a square meter without paying 5-15% commission. This is a common practice, everyone knows this. Listen, this was not a bribe, this was an extortion. Of me! They extorted me!” 

 

García Marcos unpacks that notion. “And so, he begins to caress the idea: why pay someone else when I could just become mayor and then build as much as I want? And that’s how he arrives in politics in Marbella.” Part of Gil’s nefarious genius was understanding that the public didn’t require a squeaky-clean image. Honesty, even when admitting malfeasance, was a breath of fresh air to them. It was even loveable. 

 

During a campaign rally, Gil would tell his crowd the following: “I’ll make you all rich. And I’ll clean the shit off the streets of Marbella.” It was a simple platform. It always was with Gil. He was going to make Marbella great again. Just as with Trump, and Berlusconi, in a complicated, precarious world of grey outcomes, Gil shrugged, as though society were overcomplicating things, and promised people solutions in black and white. “Why are people excited about Gil?” he asked the crowd in the third person he was becoming so accustomed to. “Because there’s a state of anxiety here. The worst thing that can happen to a city is already happening: indifference. I will change that in one year. For me it’s as simple as A, B, C. I don’t see any problems.”

 

Ultimately, Gil’s central election promise was change itself. And on that, at least, he delivered. In his 11 years in government, Marbella went from 49,000 households, to a staggering 127,000. Who knows if there are numbers for the money generated by his back-of-the-envelope property gold rush during that decade. When all was said and done, Gil left no more tangible political legacy than the brick and mortar that one can still reach out and touch today on the streets of Marbella. And it stands to reason that this had been Gil’s main political objective all along—at least to begin with. He wasn’t too bashful to admit this truth either to Jesús Quintero. Gil laid his beliefs bare:

 

Q: Why did you get into politics? What do you know about politics?

G: Me? Nothing. I don’t want to know anything. Why did I get into politics? I’ve said it a thousand times. I was president of Atlético de Madrid, I had my fame, people knew me, and I get into politics because I had millions for sale, everything was bankrupt, Marbella was ‘Mr. For Sale’, and nobody was there, no investors, no promoters, not even God Himself. Everyone left. So, I was heading for total ruin. I made myself mayor, uh, I mean I won the elections, to defend my patrimony. I mean the patrimonies of others, not mine. There was a minister once, the poor woman, I won’t say her name, she was saying: be careful with Gil, if you make him mayor, he’ll only go and put up his apartment blocks. And I thought, she must be a dickhead. Because yeah, I’ll put up my apartments, but his apartments, and your apartments too. It’s not like anybody’s selling any of them anyway. Before me, one flat was selling every six months, nobody could even pay the interest. We’ve gone from there, to me selling flats that a worth a million pesetas per metre. Is it really so bad to create wealth? And then people say, no but he’s building in a green zone. Yeah right, I’ll build a house on the branch of a tree. These people can go take it up the arse, for God’s sake. They always say the same, that I’m illegal, that I’ve violated this, I’ve violated that. I’m always violating everything. People have no solidarity. People have no gratitude. Never do anything thinking people will appreciate it. This is the human condition.

Q: Do you not believe in your fellow man? 

G: No.

Q: People say that Gil is involved with the mafia. That you protect them.

G: I don’t know anything about the mafia but let me tell you a barbarity. Maybe the mafia has to exist. Because justice doesn’t exist. The justice we have is a joke. I’ve heard that said. It’s just a sentiment I have.

Q: Have you paid off journalists?

G: No. The media calls me up. On the day they stop calling me, maybe I’m lost. But I have a capacity to respond with the truth.

Q: Have you bought judges?

G: No, you can’t buy a judge. (It would later transpire that a certain judge in Marbella, Pilar Ramírez, had re-assigned every single case against Gil to herself, only to then shelve it. Up until the intervention of the corruption unit in Madrid, not a single case against Gil had succeeded. Pilar Ramírez was promptly disbarred).

Q: Do you believe in the justice of men?

G: No. Men by their nature are unjust. We’re not perfect.

Q: Do you believe in politics?

G: I hate politics.

With his stunts and larger than life persona, Gil had indeed, as he told his friend, been busy selling Marbella. And it would ultimately be that selling of Marbella, by jumbling together the football club over which he presided and the city that he oversaw, that would land him in jail. But that was still a few years away. For now, Gil had other problems to deal with. Because just a year after landing the mayorship of Marbella, things were already starting to go wrong back in the capital city. Atlético de Madrid’s very existence hung in the balance. And if he lost this fight, it would mean that Atleti had disappeared on his watch, just as those 58 lives had in his collapsed restaurant. As Paulo Futre would say: “The only thing Gil was afraid of? It wasn’t politicians. It wasn’t judicial intervention or jail. It wasn’t even the president of the government. It was the Estadio Vicente Calderón full. Because it would make his hands sweat.”

The Atlético faithful

On the 30th of June, 1992, Jesús Gil had three hours left to pay several billion pesetas. If he failed to come up with the money, Atlético de Madrid would lose its professional status and be thrown out of top-flight football. (The team was sitting in 3rd at the time). “Jesús Gil and Enrique Cerezo became the heroes that would save the team,” said the man that would eventually put Gil in jail, prosecutor Carlos Castresana on HBO’s The Pioneer (2019). “Or at least that’s the story that was sold to the supporters,” his lips tighten into a wry smile. Renowned sports journalist, José María García, who supported Gil’s candidacy in 1987 and who we met in Part 2 of NOBODY F**KS WITH THE JESÚS, adds: “He saved Atlético de Madrid. And that salvation is what gave him ownership of Atleti. I’d have to reveal a lot of secrets but what he did is a feat of engineering.”

 

Around that same time, PSOE, the ruling Spanish Socialist Workers Party, tabled the idea of turning football clubs into sociedades anónimas—essentially, Public Limited Companies. By then, Gil had already become president of Atlético and, reader, it will not surprise you to learn that he was greatly in favour of the move. “[Before that], who owned the club? The members,” said Enrique Sánchez de León, one of Gil’s rivals in the 1987 elections for the presidency of Atlético de Madrid. “And so, what is a PLC? It is the reduction of ownership to just a mere few. That feeling of ownership, belonging, participation? It’s gone. This is now an entity. It’s now a business. And a business belonging to someone else.” Gil, speaking on television about the matter, rejected those concerns as hearts and flowers, obsolete sentimentality. “[The old model] is not viable, whatever the romantics say. For me, club members—future shareholders—they simply don’t care how the club is administered, or if the players get paid or not.” If that standpoint discommoded the Atleti faithful, Gil reminded them why they ought to be grateful. “I’m the only club president in Spain that has brought in football stars, paid for with my own money, and that has signed a guarantee with the National Sports Council that any losses will be borne at my own expense. Something that no other president has done in history.”

﻿And it was true that Gil brought in players. For himself, to then loan to the club. “I saw the players every month come into my father’s office,” said Miguel Ángel Gil Marín in 2019, son of Gil and majority shareholder (somehow) of the club to this day. “They were coming for their wages.” By this point, despite his assurances in 1987 that he would defend Atleti and put a halt to its crazy excesses of the past, the club now owed Gil a lot of money. It had only taken five years. Like a loan shark that had started out enquiring as to the health of your family, and now, somehow, you find you’re into him for 50-large. “For every peseta that he spends on supposedly sanitising the club,” explained Castresana. “He has, in reality, accounted for as a peseta that’s owed to him.” On the 13th of July, 1991, El Mundo newspaper, one of the widely-circulated in Spain, ran the following headline: 

 

JESÚS GIL ADMITS THAT HE AND THE REST OF THE CLUBS FALSIFY THE ACTUAL SALARIES OF FOOTBALLERS.

 

Spanish law stipulated that there were a number of conditions that a sociedad anónima had to meet in order to be considered economically viable. For this reason, a certain amount of capital was required upfront to cover any liabilities. Those clubs that were incapable of “sanitising” themselves economically, faced impending ruination—dissolution as a professional football club and demotion to Segunda B, the third tier in Spanish football. “In 1992, the year that these transformations are taking place,” explains Castresana. “Atlético de Madrid owes Gil around two billion pesetas (€12 million) and he has other creditors that are owed another two billion. As such, four billion pesetas are owed.” Four billion pesetas would be some €24 million—a staggering amount of money, particularly in 1992.

A decade later, in May 2002, as Gil gave evidence in the National Court, Castresana himself would rest his head in his hand, unblinking, and half-slumped in his seat, as if wearied by this enormous man’s endless endurance for excuses and fish stories. “I wanted the club to survive,” Gil protested. “Because with 4 billion pesetas of debt we were headed… Well, you know exactly where we were headed, to Segunda B—as you yourself, Mr. Prosecutor, have said so many times, it would be the disappearance of the club.” 

 

Now, reader, as I’m almost certain that you will be aware that Atlético de Madrid did not disappear. You already know Gil ‘saved’ the club. So, how did he manage to scrabble together four billion pesetas? The back of every sofa in the world still would have left him short. “My father was advised by a lawyer,” explained a grinning Miguel Ángel Gil Marín on The Pioneer. “And they created an atypical model, as was so often his way, which was to disavow the debt and say: I do not acknowledge this debt the club owes me because if I do, and there will be no-one that can save Atlético de Madrid. And what he acquires, in exchange for those two billion pesetas, is the future capital gains in the event of the sale of players by the club, once it was a PLC. This was the strategy so my father wouldn’t lose any of the money he paid in between 1987 and 1992.” 

 

Atypical, indeed. If it sounds dodgy, that’s because it was. The State’s prosecutor certainly saw it that way. A bemused Carlos Castresana analysed said atypical model thusly. “Expected future capital gains from the rise in value of players?” he shrugs his shoulders incredulously. “You, sir, are selling me smoke. Because players can become more valuable, but they can also devalue. Future perspectives can’t be objects of commerce to be bought and sold because nobody has a crystal ball with which to see the future. But all the same, they cancel the debt. [And he declares] the club doesn’t owe me anything anymore.” Back to Gil sitting in the National Court in 2002, referring to himself in the third person, and addressing a visibly frustrated Castresana. “And I’ll tell you what’s more. The board, the last thing they probably wanted to know was how my debt was cancelled. But here’s the thing, the board isn’t stupid. If Atlético de Madrid doesn’t have two bob to rub together, and Gil, who is owed 1.9 billion, from one day to the next, suddenly says he isn’t owed a thing, has the Holy Spirit visited us? Or has someone come along and given me the tip jar? The truth is one that everybody knew perfectly well.” At the time of his atypical model in the early 90s, Gil had made a wager with the Spanish State: you know what I’ve done. I know what I’ve done. But all the same, you can’t afford to kill me off. And, as he often was, he was on the money. “The politicians back then decided that they shouldn’t shoulder the political cost of allowing one of football’s historic clubs to disappear,” Castresana smiles between gritted teeth. “Because what happens afterwards? Well, there are elections. And so, the National Sports Council accepted it, and said, ah, so you, sirs, are saying that this debt has disappeared from the books? Okay, fine. Then you only have to pay the two billion [outstanding].” That was the price to avoid dissolution. The price of survival. Now Gil just had to find the money. Somehow.

On the 27th of June, 1992, Atlético faced their blood rivals, Real Madrid, in the final of the Copa del Rey, and in their own back yard to boot. The headline in El Mundo leading up to game read: GIL MORE WORRIED ABOUT FINDING 2 BILLION THAN THE FINAL. 
 Come the day itself, 70,000 spectators filled the Bernabeu to witness Atleti beat their ‘eternal rivals’ 0-2. With little more than five minutes gone, former Madridista, the bowl-haired Bernd Schuster, scored a torpedo of a free kick from a mile out. To cap it, Gil talisman and now club captain, Paulo Futre, collected a perfect counter-attack ball on 29 minutes from Manolo to smash it into the top corner at Buyo’s near post. “It was a very, very special day,” Futre told HBO. “For everything that had happened, and for the Atleti faithful, we’re talking about winning the cup at the Bernabeu. What I felt there?... If ecstasy exists, I felt it then. Because I’ve never felt what I did in that moment since, and I never will again,” he inhales shakily and then smiles. “It was incredible. It was incredible.” Gil embraced and kissed every single one of his players on the cheeks as they passed him on the VIP box towards the cup. The joy in his face gave no hint of the fear that had to have been churning in his guts. The tears of joy were barely dry on the surface of the trophy but for all the elation of the moment, disaster, as it so often was with Gil, was just around the corner. And just like his slipshod job in Los Ángeles de San Rafael had collapsed on 58 people in 1969, it seemed as if the third biggest club in Spain, was also about to collapse and die too. 

 

Three days passed. It was deadline day. 30th of June, 1992, 9pm. Gil had three hours left to pay two billion pesetas. Atlético de Madrid stood on the precipice of an abyss. There were only two outcomes. Either Gil found the money however humanly possible. Or Atlético would simply die. During a TV interview on the day, he was asked where things stood with the club’s situation. Gil, as was his trademark, made the question about himself without giving a great deal away in terms of actual detail. “I feel a certain optimism,” he puffed out his great chest swaddled in a flamboyant white silk shirt punctuated with little birds. “At 9:05am, things were bad. At 9:30am, things were better. At 10am, back to bad. It has been a day of great intensity full of lovely gestures. Even a homeless man, who was given 5,000 pesetas, brought them to me.” The TV anchor cut in. “But Mr. Jesús, let’s get to the point. In this moment, is there anyone willing to put two billion on the table, yes or no?” 

 

There was no answer.

 

But the Atleti faithful weren’t going to go down without a fight. Everybody chipped in. Once all the donations were totted up and every lovely gesture was taken into account, what was put on the table from the Colchoneros was 112 million. It was an incredible amount from a largely poor and working class fanbase. “Thousands of members bought shares,” said Castresana. “Some buy for themselves, others buy for their kids, the families of supporters buy shares, so on. But those shares represented around three percent of what was needed. So, who puts down the remaining 1.9 billion? Jesús Gil and Enrique Cerezo. And they did that for that day and that day alone. The 30th of June. How? Gil shows 1.3 billion [to the sports council] that isn’t his—that money belonged to Dorna (Dorna Sports S.L.) who have lent it to him. And Enrique Cerezo shows 600 million loaned by Crédit Lyonnais. And that same day, the 30th of June, and not the next day, they take the money back out. These two gentlemen, as such, appropriated 97% of Atlético de Madrid without paying for it. They’ve acquired shares without paying for them.” 

 

So, how did it work? Reader, suspend your disbelief, but the way in which these two men ‘saved’ the football club was via another atypical model. Gil, using Banco de Vitoria, receives a loan from Dorna for 1.3 billion pesetas. He opens an account in which to receive this money, one that has nothing to do with the football club itself, but a personal one, of which he is the sole authorised holder. And he has the bollocks to call this account ‘Atlético de Madrid PLC in Transformation’. Into this account, he transfers the 1.3 billion. It is here, in this account, that the National Sports Council views the necessary money. A snapshot is taken, if you will. Enrique Cerezo does the same thing at his end and another snapshot is taken. Thus, the Council accepts their money as kosher and, therefore, the club is correctly transformed into a PLC, all done on the up and up. “That same day,” Castresana says. “In the very next minute after the money touches the ‘Atlético in Transformation’ account, it goes straight back to Dorna’s account. The money never really left the Banco de Vitoria. And it never reached Atlético de Madrid. Enrique Cerezo did exactly the same with Crédit Lyonnais.”

Two perfect triangles. Two men dressed as firefighters, rush into a burning bank, extinguish the fire, and when they walk out triumphantly, all the money in the vault belongs to them. The perfect heist. Cerezo, today president of the club (somehow), defended himself thusly, although in almost Dr. Seussian fashion. “Listen up. The money was real money, because it was money. The bank gave it as money, and the notary saw it as money, the Council accepted it as money. If five days later, Jesús took that money in payment for what he was owed, then mate, I don’t think that has anything to do with a PLC being formed correctly or incorrectly.” Gil’s son, Miguel Ángel Gil Marín, was frank in his opinion. “That the money was there is undeniable. It’s another matter if the money was taken back a few days later. And I’m clear about it, the money was taken back in repayment for what had been paid out between ’87 and ’92. And for me that was wrong. He [my father] should have respected the agreement and waited for the capital gains if they occurred, which wasn’t guaranteed, that was his mistake. He wasn’t a thief. But I am certain that he said to himself in that moment: I paid this money, it’s now sitting here in an account, it’s available, why the fuck wouldn’t I take it back if I put it there in the first place?” José María García described Gil in 2019 in the following way. “He was a bloke that would never give up. He would never throw in the towel, even if all he had was faith. He was a poker player that went around with two 7s. Only a bloke like him, grazing illiteracy itself, but cum laude in mental agility, could have achieved what he achieved.” 

 

So, what are we left with in this counterfeit come-to-Jesus moment? The answer is 3% of the club, untainted by financial quackery or atypical models, that the fans actually paid for with real money. And even the money from that 3%, the very next day, the 1st of July 1992, Gil removed from the club account and placed into one of his shell companies. That is to say, not only did Gil and Cerezo not pay 1.9 billion pesetas to save the club, but they also plundered the 112 million pesetas the fans stumped up who actually tried to.

While I have focused more in this series on Gil’s time as club president/owner of Atlético de Madrid than his 11 years as a mayor, you can be certain that he played these same games with the municipal funds of the Marbella city council. To grossly oversimplify, he took public money and disseminated it across a series of shell companies through which he took care of city business. To this day, the Marbella council is trying to recoup money from Gil’s inheritors. And the suggestions of relocation of money from the public to the private is not, unsurprisingly, exclusive to his dealings on the south coast. Even Atleti’s old stadium itself, the very platform on which Gil had reinvented and enriched himself, has been dragged into this soap opera of suspicion and financial puzzlement. Could Vicente Calderón, the man after which the stadium was named, have imagined that the son of the impresario he had earmarked as his successor would one day demolish the altar of their common god? “The demolition of the stadium means a significant financial kick for the Gil family,” said journalist and biographer, Juan Luis Galiacho, to Antenna 3. “They say that, in theory, it will be re-invested into La Peineta (the site of the new Atlético de Madrid stadium) but we’ll have to see. What’s evident is that here [at Estadio Vicente Calderón] houses will be built and that represents a huge capital gain for the heirs to Gil’s wealth.” Seeing as the new Atleti stadium, the Wanda Metropolitano, bears the name of a Chinese conglomerate in its very name, it’s reasonable to conclude that the Gil family had some outside help with that re-investment part. It’s hard to picture a future where apartments are bought and sold on the site of the old Calderón stadium, without a single euro crossing the palms of the Gil family.

And yet, for all this, it’s easy to forget now, when the lows are so viscerally evident, how heady and intoxicating the highs were. How easy it was to let yourself go in the glory, the seductive thrill of, as Paulo Futre said, a man with whom anything was possible. There was no strategy but for all the chaos and teetering over the precipice of catastrophe, it was also undeniably exciting. Your average Colchonero didn’t know what would happen next. Who would sign on? Who would get the chop? Who Gil would sack next? His running of the club was shambolic in the conventional sense. The team hardly ever could rely on stability, always aware of some looming legal existential threat. Not to mention, they couldn’t take their wages for granted, either. “There were times,” Futre reflected. “When we didn’t see a salary for eight months out of the year.” But it’s also true that the team would never be allowed to languish in a rut, if a philosophy was not working, it would be changed. Gil knew nothing about football but he knew that if Mr. X wasn’t delivering results, then there was always Mr. Y waiting in the wings. If one rolled the dice enough times, eventually one would come up with a pair of sixes.

Radomir Antić
Radomir Antić

In 1995, Radomir Antić arrived as Atlético de Madrid manager. “We changed something very important at the club,” he would later say. “And that is learning to get along with each other. From there, we started to build a winning team, a team with good vibes.” Miguel Ángel Gil Marín characterised Antić’s arrival as “a breath of fresh air—we got off to a good start, we were winning, we were playing gorgeous football, and Radomir generated enthusiasm.” One Kiko goal that season would famously have Gil up on his feet dancing. Like a snowball gathering pace, then becoming an avalanche, Atleti’s optimism turned into belief. And that belief became conviction. “His obsession was the league,” Futre recalls. “La Liga, La Liga, La Liga. If he put down enough money, he didn’t see why it couldn’t happen.”

He was right. After eight years with Gil at the helm, Atlético finally did it. And how. 

Atleti’s trophy room
Atleti’s trophy room

They won the league conceding only 32 goals (Valencia came second and conceded 51) a full 17 points clear of Real Madrid who were left without so much as a UEFA Cup qualifying place. As if that weren’t enough, they beat Barcelona (for the third time that year), despite Hagi and Figo et al, in the final of the Cup. Milinko Pantić, the ingenious Yugoslavian midfielder, scored the only goal of the game. It was Atleti’s first league and cup double in their history. Gil would break down in tears after the match. “I don’t care if I die now.” It was a perfect moment for the team. And for the man that had done so much to conquer it. “I can’t love anything more than I love all of you!” he would shout down at the amassed fans celebrating below near Neptuno, the Madrid fountain which is home to Atleti’s triumphs. (Real Madrid celebrate at Cibeles, just up the road). That night, Gil would go back to referring to his own mortality in a live interview with Telemadrid: “If I kicked the bucket right now, at least someone would be able to say: well, there was a Quixote, who thought he knew something. The poor man, he didn’t know anything, but hey, look, he won the double.”

But like all who scale peaks, eventually one must come down to earth. And the invocation of Quixote was, perhaps, either unfortunate or prescient—the end of his story, of course, being sickness, renouncing chivalry and fictions, then death. Then again, ecstasy is to be enjoyed in the moment, not built to withstand the long-term. Nobody that day would have noticed the dark clouds gathering overhead. Even if they had been visible, nobody was interested in looking up. Who among those jubilant Atleti fans gave a thought that day to the uncomfortable fact that since Gil had arrived, they could no longer vote him in or out? (Dictatorships, after all, so often begin in democracies). That their club was no longer a club, it was a PLC? Who among them were thinking about the enviable youth system that Gil had scraped? And while Raúl González had scored an impressive 19 league goals despite only being 18 that year, who there that day gave him a second thought? Having captained Atleti’s under-15s to glory, Gil earmarked him for great things back in 1991. “These are my lads,” he would tell TV variety show Tan Contentos. “This team are the champions of Spain; they won the league scoring 264 goals in 22 matches—” he points to a small boy in the squad. “And look over there, Raúl González, my captain. He scored 55 goals! Remember his name, he will be a phenomenon.” Gil wasn’t wrong. Only he didn’t become one for Atleti but for bitter rivals, Real Madrid. Despite being fiercely antimadridista as a boy, Raúl was forced to swallow his pride and don the famous white of the club where he would become a legend. The thing that would surely rankle with Gil later on, above all, was that he’d signed with them for nothing. Zero. And finally, who among those deliriously happy fans, had wondered if this was as good as it would get?

 

I ask those questions with the benefit of hindsight, of course. And those were all worries for another day. On that balcony, above a singing surf of happiness and pride, Gil was holding two trophies in his hands. Surely, this was the moment when the plan would all come together and Atleti would usher in a great age of football dominance. With this squad and this manager, surely conquest was his for the taking? Radomir Antić didn’t see it that way. “Gil’s ambitions,” he smiles. “Exceeded reality.” 

 

The man had succeeded in football. In politics. He was a winner. And he had the track record to show for it. But he was also over 60 years old. And he made a lot of enemies. That’s the price of success. And that’s the price of thumbing your nose at the world. Gil’s luck was about to change. Could he have imagined then, that while he had just brought his football club to the zenith of its success, he would also bring it to its lowest point within just a few years? And could he have had any conception that he would be going back to jail? 

The old Carabanchel jail—where Gil would be sent

All those years of monetary monkey business had, unsurprisingly, resulted in a fair few legal banana skins. “A mayor cannot take out 450 million pesetas (from public funds) for sponsorships,” said Gil’s political opponent, Isabel García Marcos. “Unless it’s consigned by the municipal accounts, having been properly debated and approved by the comptroller. There came a time when we legally denounced [filed a lawsuit against] him for embezzlement of public funds.” Carlos Castresana himself, the prosecutor leading the corruption taskforce, recalls a letter that arrived in his office one day. “That’s how it all began. The letter was anonymous, postmarked Marbella. Opening it, I found it was photocopies of the municipal accounts from Marbella. So, we started asking them for documents.” It would, eventually, lead to police raids in 1998. 

 

Gil would wonder why it had taken the authorities so much time, given his teams (and others) had carried the name Marbella for a good few seasons now. It was his belief that it was a politically motivated State aggression given his political inroads across not just Spain but North Africa now, too. “I’ve always thought [football shirt sponsorship] was the best way of promoting cities,” he would say on the night of the police raid, again using the third person. “There is a principal objective in this: to disqualify Gil [from office].” The man seemingly failed to understand that, once you are in politics, everything is politically motivated. As ever, he played the victim card. It was Gil’s go-to move, even when he had thrown the first punch. 


 A year later, he would tell the press outside his office: “Look, they can put me in jail if they want, they can call me ‘mafioso’, ‘narco trafficker’, they can call me everything. But I think they’ve gone to hit me directly in the centre of my heart. That I can tell you. Because for me, Atlético de Madrid is my symbol, my life. It’s not a business. It’s not a business.”

He was right. In a way. Because it wasn’t a business. By now, it was a crime syndicate. El Mundo revealed in 1998 that Atlético de Madrid had defrauded close to 500 million pesetas (around €4.5m in today’s money). It was as simple as declaring one official salary for a player, and then paying them far in excess of that. Santi Denia (today Spain’s u19 manager) would officially earn 46 million pesetas, yet, in actuality, was paid 130 million. Goalkeeper José Francisco Molina declared 72 million but took home 150. Kiko (my childhood idol) officially earned 154 but was, in reality, paid 250. And star players Juninho Paulista and Cristian Vieri declared 154 and 160 respectively but both actually enjoyed a 300 million peseta pay packet. Midfield maestro Juan Carlos Valerón, who Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Roy Maakay would describe as the best player they ever played with, would shun the report. “This article doesn’t even merit any comment. For me, this newspaper has fallen very low and it doesn’t deserve my comment.” Kiko would simply call it a lie. But then again, what were they going to say given Castresana et al were breathing down their necks?

 

Twenty years later, Paolo Futre, laughed. “You’ve got Contract A, and Contract B. Put yourself in the shoes of the players. They came in [the authorities] and said hands off, nobody touch anything, give us the contracts. All the clubs did something like that. But of course, how are you going to play that? You’d go to jail. These players could have gone to jail.” Miguel Ángel Gil Marín, Atlético de Madrid CEO and son of Jesús Gil explained it thusly. “He [my father] would say, how can we have all these players and pay them all this money and the club survive? Well, by paying less taxes. So, we’ll make one type of contract. And then we’ll make another type.” Carlos Castresana spelled out what that meant for the club. “That’s why, in the club’s accounts, a new type of debt had been growing towards Gil himself and Atleti now owed him money.”

And if things were looking bad for the club president, they weren’t much better on the pitch. The 1999-2000 season was Atleti’s nadir. The quality in the squad was not the issue. It contained the likes of Rubén Baraja, Santiago Solari, Celso Ayala, Juan Carlos Valerón, Kiko, José Chamot, José Mari, Vladimir Jugovic, Juninho Paulista, and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink. Yet by the season’s end, half of that contingent would have left and Atlético would be sitting second from bottom, a full seven points beneath Numancia in 17th. At the other end of the universe, the exciting Súper Dépor team were winning their first league title. (Spare a thought for Deportivo de La Coruña today, not only are they playing in the third division, but this past December they lost at home to fiercest rivals, Celta Vigo—not their main team, but their youth team). While Atleti had beaten Real Oviedo 5-0 the first time around, the season-defining match would come against them in the return on the 8th of May, 2000. Oviedo were managed by the ever-sagacious Luis Aragonés and the match would be a tight affair with Chino Losada and Paulo Bento putting the home team in a solid lead. But Atleti were fighting for their lives. A young Joan Capdevila would pull one back (and go on to lift the 2008 Euros with the opposing team’s manager eight years later). The best Colchonero player that season, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, had notched a whopping 35 goals, and would drag the game level with 13 minutes to go, scoring a trademark ballistic header after Kiko floated in a sumptuous cross-box ball. And with five minutes left on the clock, Hasselbaink skipped away from two Oviedo players only to be hauled down in the box by Sergio Boris. The Dutchman rolled up his socks, an uneasy yet determined expression on his face. Salvation beckoned. A point would do it. He stood over the ball, hands on hips, as though a gunslinger waiting for his opponent to draw. The referee that day, José Luis Prados García, held up the penalty to remind Oviedo goalkeeper, Esteban, to stay on his line. The back and forth would cost the Asturian goalkeeper a yellow card but it would also create a delay. A delay in which, perhaps, doubt could set in. Prados blew his whistle, Hasselbaink struck the ball well enough, but Esteban elegantly palmed it away. By the first replay the commentator was already prognosticating: “It seems as if Atleti are already condemned to be in Second Division next year…” And it was true. They were, unthinkably, relegated—along with top-flight mainstays Real Betis and Sevilla. After the match, Esteban would speak almost apologetically: “I don’t want to go into the history books as a player that relegated them.” It was as if, somehow, the goalie had looked into Atleti’s future, witnessed the darkness to come, and was already washing his hands of it.The calamity almost felt cosmically-ordained. It didn’t matter how good the squad was. It didn’t matter that Hasselbaink scored 35 goals. Claudio Ranieri couldn’t stop the rot across 26 matches. The beloved Radomir Antić (his third stint) couldn’t save them in 11. Let alone Fernando Zambrano in the final game.

 

The next season, Betis and Sevilla immediately returned to La Liga. Atleti would finish level on points with Tenerife in third but six goals shy of promotion. The only bright spot was the debut of Fernando Torres, the teenage talisman. It would take Luis Aragonés himself, who had masterminded the coup de grâce of their relegation, to drag Atleti back where they belonged in 01/02. In another one of football’s never-ending quirks of fate, he would also sign goalkeeper Esteban, who competed with Germán ‘Mono’ Burgos, the corpulent assistant manager under Cholo Simeone today. The return of the club to the top flight was a relief for the red and white side of Madrid. But it wasn’t much of a redemption for Gil. Mounting legal perils, financial realities piling up, success might well have seemed hollow to him by now. Having taken the club to incredible highs where everything seemed possible, he had also sunk them to historic lows and turned them into a corrupt mess of a club. Not for nothing had the club, so often the bridesmaid and not the bride in Spanish football, been given the patronising name Pupas—something close to Diddums. If the initial laughter from their cross-town rivals had hurt after relegation. What hurt even more was that Real Madrid fans simply forgot about Atleti. It was one of those perverse epiphanies that only football can bestow: the humiliation of losing to your rivals is better than the irrelevance of not competing with them.

In 2002, Gil’s many cut corners, atypical models, and misdeeds caught up with him at last. All those long years of malfeasance and misappropriation of funds, across Madrid and Marbella, finally came to light. Facing charges of prevarication and influence peddling, (frankly, it seemed as if the State was just getting started) the Supreme Court handed down its sentence: six months of prison. But worse than that, Gil was barred from running for office for 28 years. He was 69 years old. It was over. In jail, he would be placed in solitary confinement. All those that had pressed themselves to him and elbowed their way into photographs alongside him, now flitted away, afraid of being touched by the scrofula of his corruption. All those that had opposed and questioned Gil, Isabel García Marcos and Juan Luis Galiacho and several others, who for so long were reviled and ignored, now stood vindicated.

As Gil would say, ideology is the pretext of the vain and the incapable. But maybe that was just a fancy rephrasing of: principles get in the way of action. In the end, many of those that had made their Faustian bargain by betting on Gil would find that their bargain proved to be, well, Faustian. Due to various legal wrangles, while Enrique Cerezo would find himself convicted in a court of law, he was never imprisoned due to the statute of limitations being exceeded. He took over as club president. Miguel Ángel Gil Marin, implicated in so many of his father’s deals and ventures, also avoided the judge’s gavel. He remains today the single largest shareholder.

 

Jesús Gil died on the 15th of May, 2004. His funeral turned into a national event. 25,000 people turned up to pay their respects—where else, at the Estadio Vicente Calderón. The hearse circled the stadium three times. The masses applauded, as if Gil had given the Atleti faithful one last trophy, one last success.

So, where do we go from here? Seven years after Gil’s death, Diego Simeone, who had marshalled the club’s midfield like a bodyguard and captained Atleti to its first double in ‘95/’96 returned as a manager. Success would follow, both domestically and in Europe. But more than that, a strange sense of stability. Simeone has now been at the club for a decade and would mould the team around a new ethos: nobody fucking beats us. Even today, there are few worse places to be in world football than 0-1 down to Atlético de Madrid. It could hardly be said to be a representative legacy of Gil’s running of the club. But more in spite of it. So what is Gil’s legacy?

 

Jesús Gil was never a football man, no matter the platitudes served up by that silver tongue. Ironically, for all his protestations to the contrary, for all the times he put his loathing of politics on record, the man was a born politician—even when he was still only a used car salesman. Because for Gil, every waking moment was an opportunity for spin. PR was oxygen. And none of it was bad. He felt he could talk his way in, or out, of anything. And he understood, in a far more nuanced way than Donald Trump ever will, that while fear motivated people, it wasn’t just enough to scare them. You had to install yourself as the answer and occasionally deliver once in a while. The schismatic nature of Spanish politics allowed Gil to become an exponent of modern dead cat politics long before Lyton Crosby was a twinkle in David Cameron’s eye, constantly hitting play on the same soundbite: them and us.

 

In Part 1 of this series, I asked the question: what was Gil beneath the mask? Reader, by now I’m sure you’ve guessed that it’s an impossible question to answer. For he was a man that understood that, in political life, it was much easier to succeed if you were whoever or whatever people wanted you to be. He himself would say in an interview: “At 9 in the morning I can be a communist. At 10, I can be a socialist. And at 11, I’m right-wing.” 

 

For all his flaws, he was a man from humble beginnings that touched the sky. But he was, and always would be, a convicted criminal, guilty of manslaughter. Those 58 people those lost their lives in 1969 are are still dead. And that was not the only harm that Gil caused in this world. He left financial black holes across Spain, including the fact that only 3% of Atlético de Madrid actually belongs to Atleti fans. Gil played on the hopes and dreams of ordinary people. Many of them working class and poor. From the Atleti faithful such as the homeless man that gave him his last 5000 pesetas, to the voters of Marbella, to Limamou Mbengue who today finds himself back in Senegal. He lives in a cabin in Dakar with his wife, his son, and 13 other people. “I was with Atlético de Madrid for five years without receiving a single cent. They didn’t even pay my public transport.” He makes his living today selling fruit in the street. When the scandal about the ‘fake’ players broke, Gil’s son, Miguel Ángel, approached Mbengue and promised him a good future if he would testify in their favour. “So, the judge asked me, are you worth 300 million pesetas? And I said, yes. When I finished up my contract, and here I swear on my mother’s tomb, I swear on my son’s life, I went to the stadium and I spoke with Miguel Ángel Gil and asked him about the future he promised me and he laughed in my face. He told me, no, I don’t remember that.” Holding back his emotion while speaking to Antenna 3, Mbengue added. “I would like to speak to the supporters of Atlético de Madrid because I have a lot of respect for them, and for me, they are the most noble fanbase in the world. But I sweated in that shirt for five years for free, and I defended it all over the world. And I believe that Miguel Ángel Gil and the Gil family are a cancer to Atlético de Madrid.”

Gil also fanned the flames of populism and pre-democracy nostalgia in a country which really, really could have done without it. Franco’s totalitarian regime in Spain lasted until his death, well into the 1970s. They are still digging up unidentified bones to this day. (Amnesty International puts Spain only second to Cambodia in the world for mass graves).  
 
 Did Gil spend sleepless nights wondering how things would have turned out if only he’d paid for a damn surveyor. Turned down the money from the SPAR dinner? Or was it the tragedy that made him? Forcing him to cover a mountain of compensation, driving him towards greater and more visible platforms on which to build his castles in the sky? 

 

And yet, for all the savvy and cunning, for all the aces up his sleeves, for all the thousands of people who queued up to believe him, to vote for him, to anoint him as their leader, in the end, the ultimate naiveté was that of Gil himself—to believe that he could go forever. Like the figure of Don Quixote he likened himself to on the night of winning the double, all those years of charging at giants would, in the end, prove futile. The giants are immoveable.

 

By the end, his whole life had become a tessellation of transgressions. Did he wonder how it had all gone so far? Did he ask himself why he had taken the path that he had? And did he question, in quiet moments alone with his horse, who he had become in his old age—titan? Tycoon? Tyrant? I wonder if even Gil knew who he was in those final days. 

 

As his son, Miguel Ángel Gil Marín said: “I always drew a distinction between the man and the character. As a person, he was one of the best human beings I’ve ever met, for his values, and as a father. But as a character in the public eye, as a populist, the pendulum swings from love to hate… I tried to hide from that character. Because I loved the man. When you live so many hours next to a persona such as my father… I wouldn’t like it, for example, as his woman. To suffer it. Because in the end it is suffering, more than enjoying it. Because he was always in the eye of the hurricane, both in politics and in business.” 

 

If his own son was bisecting Gil’s personality into different categories, sixteen years after his death and never having met him, I certainly have no definitive, black and white answer. Can a man’s actions and convictions define him? In Gil’s empire of shadows and half-truths, perhaps the most plausible answer is that Gil was who his mother had made him into. As Gil’s brother, Severiano Gil y Gil, would say to HBO: “our mother would tell us: even if you’re miserable, you hold your head up high like a serpent, never let them see that you’re sunk because they’ll crush you underfoot.”


How will he be remembered in time? A larger than life figure who made fortunes, both for himself and others, forged destinies, but also heralded ruin and death? How many have done what he has done? How many men or women have built towns out of thin air? How many have brought glory to thousands of supporters flooding the streets of their city in historic jubilance? There again, how many are responsible for the death of 58 people? Incalculable financial damages that destroyed dreams? As for what Gil’s legacy is, even now I’m honestly not sure. Maybe it’s simply this: nobody fucked with the Jesús.

But I give the last word to the man himself. It’s what he would have wanted. To the question: what epitaph would you have on your gravestone? Gil responded: “I don’t know. Maybe something like: Here lies an imbecile who thought things could be better. Yes, that’s it. And the only bitterness I will take with me to the next world? That I believed that Spain could have been better.”

Following the results of the 2nd r/atletico survey it is possible that many subscribers were left wondering about the question on the current board of directors. Why? Aren’t we doing great lately? Especially notable is the difference between respondents from the Madrid area and the rest of the world.
My personal opinion is that someone is doing their job really well at Atleti. Ever since Torres was sold, almost all signings have been spot-on, creating value both on the pitch and in the treasury of the club. The fan base is expanding, we have good results and reducing our huge debt. Simeone was a gift of the gods, but let’s not forget that before him Aguirre put us back in Champions League and Quique made us champions after 15 years, which is something many of us feared would never happen again.
I don’t think the mastermind behind this is either the president Cerezo or CEO and majority shareholder Gil Marín. However, at the very least, we need to give them credit for letting the right people do their job and not interfering with them. Someone is finally thinking long-run and our current good situation is a result of it.
Why can’t many people forgive them? I’m starting this series so that r/atletico knows the history of how Gil Marín’s father (Jesús Gil) became president of the fan-owned club by popular vote and then, together with Cerezo, transformed it into a private company fully owned by himself. He had tons of problems with justice, went to prison several times and the club was found to be used as a money laundering machine, which ended with a judicial administration and a relegation to Segunda División that same year. Notice that I’m not saying “allegedly” because all of this was judged and all appeals are final. That's the tl;dr if you want to stop here.
This is not really OC; I’m basing it on a brilliant series by the user Garate9 in the colchonero.com forum (link to the Spanish original). However, that series was aimed at a different public – people familiar with most of the names and with Spanish politics and justice system. I’m not translating directly: I’m simplifying some things, cutting some others and giving some background where I think a non-Spanish fan may need it.
The original series had 8 chapters and was super long. I'll try to make this one as shorter and readable as possible, but the story is still complex and I don't want to miss important details. Also, I found that there are almost no sources about this in English in the whole internet, so someone has to be the first.
Chapter 1. Gil becomes president
To understand why Gil won the 1987 election we need to think of the situation those years. Atleti was in a decadence phase after the glorious decade of the 70s. Since the early 80s, Atleti had started to sell its most prominent players in order to make ends meet and refrain from expensive signings.
In this context, Vicente Calderón (yes, the one after whom the stadium is named, who had been president during the best years) had to come back to put some order in 1982. Despite these financial problems, a very decent team was arranged thanks to the excellent academy we had, and a couple of good signings. That team managed to stay at the top side of the table, but was never really a challenger for the league. In fact, the 80s ended with no titles, except for the Cup of 1985.
Calderón’s last season (1986/87) was terrible in league, where we finished out of the top group and could not contend for the top six spots (it was the only Spanish league to ever be played with a play-off system). We made it to the Cup final, but at that moment it felt like a lottery that had just gone lucky.
In this atmosphere of low morale, Calderón passed away and new elections were called. Several candidates were contending, but what really made the difference was Jesús Gil’s commitment to sign Paulo Futre at his own expense. Futre was the star of Porto, who had just shocked the world in the European Cup final against Bayern with skills comparable to Maradona’s.
All candidates promised great things, but this one put his money where his mouth was and came forward with a binding contract with Futre. The majority of fans voted for him for this reason, and he delivered.
Other of his big projects were to make the club more profitable by mass sponsoring, opening luxury restaurants in the stadium or even making the Manzanares river navigable and opening boat restaurants (!?). In a way, he was a visionary of modern football.
But, who was Jesús Gil anyway? Let’s stop the story for a moment.
He was a major celebrity in Spain, but maybe you guys need some introduction. It’s difficult to describe him with words: self-made man, trashy, funny, morbidly obese, hot-headed, showman, tacky, irreverent, simple, corrupt, witty… all of them fit. But sometimes an image talks louder than words. Jesús Gil was, over all things, this guy. He was also this guy and this guy.
I watch this and I can’t stay mad at him. After all, he was a very funny and relatable man. He had his own TV show where he appeared giving the least appropriate life advice. He talked about his time in prison the same way you would talk about your holidays. Most importantly he was one of us. He was the exact opposite of the posh madridista stereotype. He hated Real Madrid’s guts and wouldn’t care to say it out loud. He enjoyed every minute of being Atleti’s president. He repeated constantly how he wanted to be buried in the Atleti flag he kept in his office, and he apparently was when he died in 2004 (SIDE NOTE: I say apparently because, like Elvis, there’s a myth about him faking his own death to escape justice. Everyone always considered it a legend until last year, when this video was captured. That’s Villar, president of the Spanish FA, asking Gil Marín “How’s your father doing?”, to which he replies “Fine, fine.” WHAT. THE. FUCK.)
He made an impressive career as a real estate developer, which earned him a big fortune and also his first spell in prison (1969-1971) when a building of his star development project collapsed due to faulty materials, killing 56.
Around the time he was planning the conversion of Atleti into a private company, he created his own political party, whose initials were his name: GIL (Grupo Independiente Liberal – classy as fuck). He won a majority in the town of Marbella, home of some of the most exclusive compounds in the Costa del Sol, basically by pumping money like no other local campaign had ever done. It is said that he would go to every bar in town, order a coffee, chat around with everyone, pay with a banknote of 10,000 pesetas and leave the change as a tip (coffee was ca. 100 pesetas). He was a whole new level of populism.
Any mayor during the golden years of the Spanish real estate bubble had chances to be corrupt. They had the power to reassign land plots for building purposes, which made their prices skyrocket. The clear confusion of interests between local governments, savings banks and real estate developers led to one of the most shameful episodes of our recent history. But Gil took it to the next stage. Marbella boomed as a center for high-end leisure and attracted all sorts of sketchy real estate investors. Among them it is said the Russian mob, who would have taken advantage of the vicinity to Gibraltar and made Marbella its headquarters in Western Europe. Corruption became the system, but since money didn’t stop coming, it was sustainable and every single layer of local government benefitted from it. In the short term, it looked like Marbella was swimming in money. He won two re-elections as mayor that way.
When shit hit the fan in the 2000s, the Spanish government had to dissolve the municipality and appoint external administrators for the town, because every single elected official (GIL’s and opposition) was either in prison or indicted in the largest corruption proceedings known to date in Spanish judicial history.
Well, now you know the man. It's important because the connection between Marbella and Atleti is a key part of the story. Let’s leave it for the next chapter.

On my last post we learnt about who was Jesús Gil and how he became Atleti’s president in the first place. Today we will see how he went from president to owner. Again, credit to Garate9 of colchonero.com. This translation/adaptation is based on his work.
Chapter 2. Atlético’s transformation into a private company.
We left the story when Gil brought Futre. He went on to sign some other big names, but most of them past their prime like Goikoetxea and López Ufarte (not to miss for Armando Ufarte, Atleti legend from the 60/70s). He also fired Luis Aragonés as coach. These first years are marked by turmoil, constant changes of manager, including an uprising by the squad which ended in the sale of several important players that were very poorly replaced.
Some mediocre years came until 90/91, with the signings of Vizcaíno and Schuster. On that season we ended as runner-ups in league and won the Cup after eliminating Barcelona and Real Madrid. For the next year, good news: Luis Aragonés was hired as coach again.
Season 91/92 was the best in many years. We ended second again after fighting for the league until the very end, but most importantly, we beat Real Madrid in the Cup final at Santiago Bernabéu. This is one of the historic matches of Atlético with goals by Futre and Schuster, with Luis on the bench.
Gil seemed to have finally touched the right key and he was popular among the fans. It’s around this time when Gil put in place the plan he had in mind since the very beginning: transforming the club into a company and becoming owner of it.
Explanation: football teams had been historically organized in the legal form of “sports clubs”. A sports club has autonomy to dictate its own rules and to accept members at its will, who become owners of a proportional share of the club. The main difference between a club and a company is that clubs accept members personally and all members are strictly equal and can’t accumulate more than one share. Companies follow the capitalistic logic, where shares are tradable assets that can be exchanged for money and be accumulated.
In the 80s and early 90s almost all clubs in the Spanish league were highly indebted; and Atleti was no exception. It was argued that the legal form of sports clubs was inefficient by modern standards, because it diluted the responsibility and created wrong incentives. In a way it seems true; as fans we care exclusively for the sports results and tend to neglect the financial part of the game, which (it was argued) was the cause for the irresponsible indebtedness. Converting clubs into companies would solve the problem, because the owners of shares would care both for the sports part (as it is the main source of revenue) but also of the long term fiscal soundness of the entity. In principle, nothing prevented from allotting one share of the company to each member of the club, so that the property could theoretically still remain with the fan base.
(BTW time has proven this hypothesis wrong).
Gil was one of the proponents of this solution and he promoted it strongly with the help of the most famous sports pundit at the time in Spain, who was friends with him. They lobbied for it and sold it as the miracle solution for all of football’s problems. In 1990 a law was passed whereby all sports clubs playing in professional leagues (1st and 2nd division in the case of football) needed to become companies by 1992, except the ones who had positive financial results for the last 4 leagues (a taylor-made exception for guess who).
A special type of company was regulated for this purpose (sports company), but if you read the law, it really is fundamentally the same as any other commercial company except for a few reporting requirements, and the minimum share capital (think Eibar last year).
So the transformation had to start. Gil was granted authorization to skip the 1991 election because of this, although, to be honest, he would most probably have won. But here is the catch: in order to clean the balance sheets of the clubs, the new companies would have to start over with a share capital that set-off the current debt. In other words, if a club was worth 500 million, but owed other 500 million, the new company could not have a share capital of 500 million and just assume the debt; it needed to have a capital of 1000 million.
Given the huge debt of many clubs, the high price to pay for the same share of the company discouraged current members (socios) from buying shares of the new companies. Only a very small minority of shares were sold among the former socios, as Gil expected. With this situation, the deadline for the incorporation of the company (30 June) came close and Atleti was nearly 2,000 million pesetas short in share capital (12 mio € not counting inflation, a lot back then). This meant the disqualification to play professional football, i.e., the team that had just amazed the world with Schuster and Futre’s goals in the Cup final against Madrid at Bernabéu was going to be relegated to the third division (2ª B). This was the thrill Gil wanted to make his appearance.
Everybody was expecting that he would somehow manage to avert the disaster. At the very last moment, 15 minutes before midnight, Gil appeared as a savior and saved the day. It was the perfect image for him: without Gil, Atleti was doomed; Gil had saved Atleti; Gil was Atleti.
There are two stories about how this happened:
1- Gil’s “official” story: at the very last minute, he obtained a credit by putting all his personal fortune as guarantee, bought the remaining shares and saved the team (and coincidentally became its owner).
2- The story that the Supreme Court of Spain considered as proven in its judgment of 4 June 2004: Gil and Cerezo were co-authors of a crime of undue appropriation and took advantage of their position in the club to divert money from it and make it pay for itself (in their names).
What you need to understand here is that in Spanish criminal law all felonies EXPIRE. This means, if there is no prosecution started within a certain number of years, no charges can be pressed anymore. Public opinion rages often about this, but most legal professionals consider it necessary.
The thing is, it is not always super clear when a crime was “completed” and the clock for the expiration starts ticking, especially with financial crimes. So in this case, Gil’s defense lost in the first and second instance courts, which considered the crime not expired and went on to judge him as guilty. After appealing, the Supreme Court had a more favorable interpretation about the expiration date and released him of charges on the basis of expiry alone, but did not contradict that the facts had happened. This resulted in the odd situation of a judgment saying “well, we know this happened but we can’t punish you” (in a normal situation, courts don’t even judge the facts if they have expired, so there’s no “guilty” or “innocent” verdict).
So, how did he do it? We’ll let the Supreme Court speak for itself:
“When he first gained the presidency, Jesús Gil had decided to make the club his property. For that purpose, he tried to confuse the club’s estate with his own.” (…)
“With this intent, Jesús Gil, assisted by Enrique Cerezo, made Atlético de Madrid recognize debts in his favor, not previously reflected in the club’s accounts, by means of deeds signed before public notaries…”
To summarize, by 1992 Gil was a creditor of the club for around 2,000 mio pesetas, corresponding to federative rights for players he claims to have paid with his personal money and then assigned to the club. All of this under recognition by the club (i.e. Cerezo).
Gil wanted to pay for the shares of the new company by cancelling the supposed debt he had against the club, which coincidentally is around the same amount that was required for the minimum share capital. The sports authorities refuse, because with a higher debt, the necessary share capital would rise to 4,000 mio.
“When Jesús Gil realized that his plan to obtain the property of the new company via debt set-off was not feasible, he sought a new solution for this purpose…”
That new solution consisted in the club assigning Jesús Gil the federative rights of all 30 players in the team (à la third-party ownership) as a payment for the fake debt. Then, as soon as the club would be transformed into a sports company, he would re-sell them to the team for an amount equivalent to what he had to pay in exchange for the shares of the new company.
“This transaction was made to avoid complying with the legal requirements of the transformation of clubs into companies, both in relation to the calculation of the minimum share capital, and to the actual payment of such capital. Jesús Gil would so be immediately reimbursed of the money he paid for the shares with the re-sale of the federative rights of the players…”
“Since the payments had no other function than simulating the purchase of the share capital, in order to have them immediately reimbursed, Jesús Gil wrote a letter on 30 June 1992 to the bank Banco de Vitoria requesting, as president of the new company, the repayment to his own personal account of 1,300 mio in exchange for the federative rights of the players" (…)
Similarly, another letter was sent to Credit Lyonnais on 3 July 1992 requesting the repayment of 650 mio to Enrique Cerezo, for the same concepts (…).
Jesús Gil and Enrique Cerezo had signed a different agreement whereby the latter sold his recently acquired shares to the former (…). This way, Jesús Gil became owner of 95% of the shares, without him or Enrique Cerezo having executed an actual payment of either 1,300 mio or 650 mio., and thanks to the debts he had been recognized in his favor…”
To summarize:
A- Gil and Cerezo buy the shares with a loan for 2,000 million pesetas.
B- Gil charges Atletico de Madrid plc 2,000 million pesetas for the re-sale of its own players.
C- Gil and Cerezo return the 2,000 million and Gil buys Cerezo his stake, as previously agreed. He did sell him later 9% of his 95%.
Result: Gil becomes owner of Atlético de Madrid with money coming from the club itself. Nothing can be done now, since no one claimed against it until it was too late.
You might think that this trick had in fact saved Atleti. This is what many people thought and why most fans supported Gil for many many years. At the end of the day, if it's for the better and it doesn't affect the team's results, maybe it's forgivable. For the last chapter we will see that in fact Atleti's judicial history only starts there. The worst was yet to come.

==== (Part 3 of the Gil saga) The rollercoaster of the 90's ====
submitted 1 year ago by maeseCaracórner
On the first part of the series we learnt about how Jesús Gil became president, and on the second part how the Spanish justice considered proven that he used his position to become owner of Atleti fraudulently. My initial idea was to just write 3 episodes on the history of the legal problems of the club and only mention the sports part lightly. I decided to add an additional episode about how the team did during these years to give a bit more of context. Also we get to revisit some great moments (yay!!).
Again, credit to Garate9 of colchonero.com. This translation/adaptation is based on his work.
===== Chapter 3: The rollercoaster before the downfall =====
Before discussing the legal stuff, we left the story in 1992, with a remarkable Cup champion squad, two international stars (Futre and Schuster), both of Spain’s centerbacks and a great project led by Atleti legend Luis Aragonés.
Gil had just “saved” the team and it looked like we had someone sensible in charge, we were building a great squad and had solid project. We were back to our place. Sadly, 92/93 was a terrible year. After a great start in league and CWC, a bad streak put us behind in the table. A bad match drawn against Madrid at home tipped the scale. Luis criticized Futre’s apathy and they argued. Gil supported the coach. As a result, Futre was sold to Benfica, which proved a bad move for both Atleti and him.
That was the “official” story. Now I’ll give you just a taste of how Gil’s dirty businesses affected the team on the pitch: years later, when responding before justice about his corruption scandals in Marbella (the posh holiday town Gil was mayor of, remember part 1), Gil declared that “I have never taken any money from Marbella to Atlético; all the contrary. I had to sell Futre in order to pay the town’s salaries because it was broke.” That's just great.
In fact, they had clashing characters, but they weren't enemies. Futre himself re-hired Aragonés as a coach when he was sports director in the 2000s, and when asked about their bad relationship in the past he answered that his signing for Benfica had nothing to do with Luis and, as far as he knew, it was caused by financial problems. He even dedicated him a very touching obituary (Spanish only, sorry).
Well, Luis resigned after another terrible match against Barça and Schuster saw the panorama and left as soon as he could. Another great project in ruins.
Some terrible signings followed the next few years and again, chronic instability. In 93/94 we had six different coaches. In 94/95 we had Maturana, the successful Colombian coach who impressed the world in the USA World Cup. He asked for Klinsmann and the German was willing to sign, but then Gil said that his alleged homosexuality could be a problem in the dressing room. Well, he said it with different, blunter words.
Those two seasons we were really close of playing the relegation play-off (4 points and 1 point), and were only saved in the last few weeks.
95/96. Our new coach Radomir Antic came to this desolation. The signings that year were unimpressive. Molina and Santi, from the almost relegated Albacete. Penev, discarded from Valencia and coming out of an illness. Pantic, a complete unknown Serbian, personal request from Antic. Biagini, Correa, Roberto, promising but untested.
Well, these questionable signings, together with the guys who had been struggling to avoid relegation for two years, would end up forming the line-up every single colchonero (old enough) can recite by heart: Molina, Toni, Geli, Solozábal, Santi, Vizcaíno, Caminero, Simeone, Pantic, Kiko, Penev.
For the first half of the season we were a machine, with the “advantage” of not playing in Europe, we seemed like safe champions by February. Then the important Cup fixtures started, including a legendary match against Valencia, and fatigue started to take its toll (the XI above almost never changed). Add to this that that year the league featured 22 teams and lasted 42 weeks (Celta and Sevilla were supposed to be relegated for administrative reasons but the FA backed off last minute). Similarly to 2014, we could have closed the deal weeks in advance, but nerves failed. Week 41 we draw against Tenerife. Aguilera, rojiblanco at heart, missed a clear chance that would have complicated things enormously. Last match against the weak Albacete. We needed a victory and we didn’t miss this time. Extasis.
As for the Cup, we had eliminated fierce opposition towards the final against Barcelona. That match was extremely hard, went on to extra time and was decided by Pantic’s only header goal in his whole career. What a way of winning a final! A goal by the undisputed MVP of the season, unknown to the world just a few months ago!
Only double in our history. Gil ordered a bust of Pantic to be sculpted in remembrance, and this bouquet of fresh flowers still appears every single match on the south-east corner in his honor, brought by this adorable lady. Don’t dare to touch it or the Calderón will be all over you.
The following year started full of excitement for our participation in Champions League for the first time in many years. With some reinforcements (even Ronaldo was in the pipeline but Barça intervened), the backbone of that champion squad remained. The team was not up to the expectations: we were out of the fight for the league soon and Barça eliminated us in Cup with a hysterical 5-4. In Champions League we faced Ajax, a powerhouse back then, in quarterfinals. We drew 1-1 in Amsterdam and lost to an extra time goal at home, after a missed penalty by Esnáider. It was hard at the moment because expectations were high, but all in all it was not a terrible year, considering what came later.
97/98 saw some impressive signings: Juninho, Lardín and Vieri. Even Futre was back! Only the Italian lived up to the expectations, with beauties such as this one. Juninho started too focused in Brazil NT, had some injuries and was ultimately wrecked by Celta’s (later Madrid’s) Míchel Salgado. It was a shame because that guy was on his way to be a superstar. Lardín was a huge disappointment. Futre was way past his prime and very conflictive, he eventually left to Japan.
The midfield suffered without Simeone. It was a very inconsistent year with great matches followed by terrible matches. We made it to the UEFA semifinals though, but at the end of the year Antic, Geli, Pantic, Caminero and Vizcaíno left. In two years there was nothing remaining from that legendary double squad.
Just before the start of the following season Vieri leaves and is not replaced. The fans were confused: where did the money go? Arrigo Sacchi was the new coach, but he lasted less than a year. Antic came back after him and the season ended with a Cup final very badly lost against Valencia.
One word defines this era: inconsistency. The team was never bad, we were undisputedly the third “biggest” team in Spain (the dispute for the 2nd place was definitely lost to Barcelona in the 80s), and had enough prestige and fanbase to attract first line players. But no project seemed to last. At least twice in these 8 years we had top-class squads capable of absolutely anything. Both times the project was in shambles when the first obstacles came. Every season seemed like a lottery. Still, we got to see our best year ever, some European action and some finals. Behind the scenes, a very dark business was cooking and it exploded in season 1999/2000, the worst of our history. The last episode will be devoted to what happened that year on the pitch and outside of it.

==== [History time] How a whole generation of atléticos got PTSD (final part of the Gil saga). self.atletico ====
submitted 1 year ago by maeseCaracórner
Previously: how Jesús Gil became president, how he used his position to become owner of Atleti fraudulently and how the 90s seemed like a rollercoaster under his management. For this last episode, we will see how shit finally hit the fan (pun intended).
Inspired by Garate9 of colchonero.com and his brilliant saga. For this part I used other journalistic sources too (El Mundo, El País) and a lot of my own memory.
Chapter 4: Highway to Hell
For 1999/2000 we had great signings. Toni, Olympic champion GK. Gamarra, great CB. Hasselbaink, Premier League’s topscorer. On the bench Claudio Ranieri, Valencia’s rainmaker. Expectations were better than ever. Who would tell.
We beat Real Madrid for the last time in 15 years. The next time it happened r/atletico already existed.
Otherwise the team was already doing terrible (4th to last) when the news came and hit like thunder: as part of the judicial proceedings against Jesús Gil, the club was seized and put under judicial administration.
Why? Short answer: because the club itself was instrumental in many of his dirty maneuvers.
Remember Marbella from chapter 1? The posh holiday city where Gil won the election as mayor? It is known as the “ground zero” of the Spanish real estate bubble. Gil wanted to expand his business and promoted candidates in other coastal cities in the area, many of which won the 1999 local election (including the autonomous city of Ceuta). The joke was starting to turn too serious and someone high up decided to open a thorough investigation. They found corruption was so widespread and prices were so artificially inflated it ended up as the center of the biggest corruption scandal known to date.
As it turned out, one of the ways Jesús Gil was laundering the money from his corrupt business was by making it look as legal payments to a company of his property: Atlético de Madrid. The town of Marbella paid a huge amount to sponsor Atleti, but it was just a diversion to take the money out of the public treasury into Gil’s private estate. You can only imagine the public prosecutor displaying in court our glorious red&white shirt as “Exhibit A” of his case.
Wasn't this to benefit Atleti? Not really. At the same time Gil was diverting money out of Atleti into his own pocket. The most picturesque way was by signing unknown African “rising stars” on his expense and reselling them to Atleti for a huge profit. Actually, they were just random people, some of them refugees who were seeking asylum in Europe, and never got to play a single minute for the team. If you think this is too absurd to be true, think again: I’m just quoting the Supreme Court judgment of 2004 I mentioned in part 2 of this series.
Another sketchy business was that of the overprice for signings. Apparently, Atleti was paying above-market sums for players through opaque Dutch companies (that’s why Radek Bejbl or Bogdanovic cost almost as much as Ronaldo to Barcelona). The explanation was that it was a forward payment for free players. These companies would break the rule that forbids negotiating a contract directly with a player until 6 months before his engagement with his current team is over. Most payments were stopped by the judicial administrators, so we’ll never know how stinky was this. Best case scenario, just circumventing FIFA rules. Worst case who knows.
On 3 April 2000, judicial administrator Luis Manuel Rubí, after auditing the accounts, declared that the club was “technically bankrupt”. That month’s salaries were paid thanks to a favorable FIFA decision regarding a payment owed by Glasgow Rangers for the signing of Romanian defender Daniel Prodan.
When the final judgment about the Marbella sponsorship was delivered in 2002, Gil was found guilty but Atlético was declared not liable for the monetary debt. Thank God because that would have ended the team forever.
So, this was the situation. For most of the year the club was run by judicial administrators who only cared for auditing and finding evidence against Gil. Players and staff didn’t know if they were going to be paid. Rumor was the club was bankrupt, and it was finally confirmed. Many feared it would be relegated to amateur category or disappear altogether.
In this atmosphere we kept losing and losing. The league started really bad anyway, but the judicial administration only made things worse. 3 weeks to go and we needed to win every single match, and have Oviedo or Numancia lose every match, just to avoid relegation. We tied against Oviedo, with a missed penalty by Hasselbaink, and the fate was sealed.
And here comes what I consider an absolutely life-defining moment. Older atléticos around please confirm if you see it like that too. Somehow in the middle of this craze we made it to the Copa del Rey final against the relatively accessible Espanyol. We were already relegated when we played it.
That was it! We are Atleti, capable of the best and the worst! If someone is going to be relegated and be champions at the same time; play in second division and in Europe at the same time, that has to be us!! And it’s not like we’re facing Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia or Deportivo, it’s Espanyol. We really can do this!
Well, not only we lost. We lost to this (TW: Tamudo). On top of that, Toni, our GK, was a former Espanyol teammate.
It was sadistic. Can’t the Gods just relegate us the normal way? Do we have to be special even for this?
After this horror show, the number of season ticket holders almost doubled, but we didn’t get the promotion on the first year on mere goal difference. Destiny tricking us again. On the second year Luis Aragonés renounced to play the Champions League spot he had earned for Mallorca and came back home to put his beloved team back in its place. We didn’t have to celebrate our centennial in Segunda. Gil died and the Supreme Court declared the expiration of the fraudulent appropriation of the club (see part 2), so the property of Atleti will remain with his heirs until they decide to sell it. Several gray years, and we got to this, this, this, this, this, this this, this and this. Also this, which is the most proud I’ve ever felt.
This is who we are. Not everyone is brave enough to be one of us, and that's OK. If we wanted comfort, we would have chosen another team.

=== Out of the Real world (May 8th 1999) ===
By Richard Whittle
 
 
===== What does Atletico Madrid represent in Spain and throughout the world of football? =====
Madrid's other team and, to all Glasgow Celtic fans, one of the most vicious bunch of thugs ever to take the field in a European Cup tie. El Atleti have always lived under the giant shadow of Real; a pauper compared to Real's aristocracy. While Real are all style, Atletico have earned a reputation as the thought police of world football. However, times have changed and the likes of Juninho have blunted the hard edge.
 
===== Is this reputation justified? =====
Atletico have had to fight for everything. Franco favoured Real who deemed them unworthy of even rival status. The club has always been on the defensive, reflected by their choice of coaches. The master of the catenacio Helenio Herrera brought the club two Liga titles. Austrian disciplinarian Max Merkel followed him, but the club's uncompromising reputation was built around Juan Carlos Lorenzo. He played for the infamous Argentinian side, Estudaintes, in the late 60's and was more than eager to emplor the same tactics in Europe. They kicked their way to the European Cup final in 1974 before falling to Bayern Munich in a replay. Lorenzo's boys had two sent off in the semi-final against the Bhoys of Celtic and a reputation was cemented.
 
===== Who kept it going? =====
While the playing staff have failed to live up to the 70's hard-men, president Jesus Gil has kept the club in the headlines through fist-fights, public slanging matches and all manner of threats and outrageous proclamation.s Thirty coaches have come and gone since the mayor of Marbella took over in the mid-80s. He reduced Arrigo Sacchi to tears and early retirement, but has put his money where his mouth is and given his coaches untold financial backing. Radi Antic is a brave man though, returning for his second spell under the axe-man Gil.
 
===== How is the club financed and does the future look bright? =====
Gil's millions are evident all round the club. The city of Marbella sponsors the club and one of Gil's property development offices are under the main stand. As long as Gil keeps the money coming in Atletico won't have many sleepless nights.
 
==== THE PLAYERS ====
===== Who are the club's all-time greats? =====
Atletico are more famous for their coaches than players. Spain's greatest goalkeeper and national hero, Ricardo Zamora, led the team to two titles in the early 40s and Helenio Herrera did the same 10 years later. However, it is Vicente Calderon who deserves the greatest credit. The late president fought a constant battle to keep the club afloat while Real ruled the world. More recently, anyone from the title-winning team of 1996 is hailed as a hero.
 
===== Who is the cult hero? =====
Long-term injury victim Kiko in the many the team misses more than any other. The striker led the scoring charts when the club won the title in '96 and until his ankles gave out this season he was still the fans' favourite. Christian Vieri nearly won that honour, but when he quit the club for Lazio his name became dirt.
 
===== Who is the current crowd favourite? =====
In a team of international stars it is the young Spanish striker Jose Mari who gets the fans to their feet. His perfect balance, quick feet and incisive dribbling have drawn comparisons to Michael Laudrup. Roberto, who can play either on the right of midfield or up front, is another rising star. Juninho will always be a favourite and is finally returning to his pre-injury form.
 
===== Who to throw your Tortilla at? =====
With the players losing their Sacchi inhibitions the season is looking much brighter. The Italian coach dropped Juninho and left the young players out in favour of his countrymen. Temporary coach Carlos Sanchez Aguiar brought back the Brazilian, dropped the ineffective central defender Torrisi and told everyone to have a bit of fun. Now Antic has got Atletico playing enterprising football again.
==== THE STADIUM ====
===== Describe the local area =====
The industrial south-west of the city doesn’t have many attractions and the area around the Estadio Vicente Calderon is grim and colourless. The stadium is tucked in between the Manzanares river and a series of sweeping dual carriageways. Although the San Isidro cemetery is on one side and the local Mahou brewery on the other, the Calderon does have a faded charm of its own. The red-and-white striped façade needs a lick of paint, but the bars below the stand are real working-class shrines to the club. It may not have the glamour of the Bernabeu, but there is a down-to-earth feeling and there’s even a bar inside the ground selling Mahou beer, or course.
 
===== How do you get to the stadium? =====
It’s not far from the old centre of the city and the excellent metro network takes you there in no time. Take Metro Line 5 to Piramides then head right across the large Glorieta de las Piramides roundabout. You won’t see the stadium until you are halfway down the hill, but when you do it looks like a giant circus tent.
 
===== What is the view like? =====
Even with a capacity of 62,000 the all-seater Calderon feels quite compact. The steep tiers offer good views but be warned: three sides are uncovered. The covered side is called the preferente with the palco preference B being the most expensive at around 9,000 ptas. A VIP box with room for 25 seats has just been opened and there are plans for further expansion. At the other end of the scale, behind the goals in the anfiteatro de fonde norte or sur the views are still excellent and you get closer to the ultra culture. Prices start at around 3,000 ptas. The Atletico hardcore head to the fonde sur, so it’s worth going to the fonde norte to take in the choreography at the other end.
 
===== How easy is it to get a ticket? =====
Unless Real or Barcelona are the visitors, there are no problems getting a ticket even on match day. The main ticket offices are at gates 8 and 68 and there are always touts who can easily e knocked down in price nearer kick-off. Remember, Liga games generally kick-off on a Sunday at five in the evening, or seven in the spring and early summer.
 
===== What have been the highlights? =====
Few and far between with the last memorable back in 1996, after the Liga title was secured. Around 200,000 fans converged on the Vicente Calderon to celebrate. It was also used in the 1982 World Cup when France strutted their stuff against Northern Ireland and Austria.
 
==== THE FANS ====
===== How do Atletico fans compare with their rivals? =====
Los colchoneros (the Mattress Makers) – so named after their red and white shirts originally borrowed from Athletic Bilbao – have one of the best-organized and colourful followings around. The main ultra group, El Frente Atletico (the Atletico Heads), who stand in the fonde sur, are the closest thing to Italian ultras in Spain. They sing and chant for the full 90 minutes, wave the red, white and blue flags and bash out an incessant drumbeat, backed by what seems to be native-American chanting. There is even a racoon mascot dressed in a native-American headgear who runs on before kick-off to gee everyone up.
 
===== It sounds more like an American university game? =====
Not quite. They also have repertoire of cheesy 70s pop songs. They may like to sit and be entertained in the Bernabeu, but in the Calderon they want to get involved.
 
===== Are they disliked as much as Real Madrid fans? =====
Just about. Atletico have a strong travelling support which has made its presence felt at away games. Like Real fans, they sing about Madrid’s regional pride which doesn’t go down well in other parts of their country.
 
===== How do they get on with their city rivals? =====
Atletico draw their support from the solid working-class districts in the centre and south of the city. They are proud that the club wears the city’s emblem on their shirts. As Real think a game against Barcelona is more important, el Atleti will do anything to put one over them. Real’s exit from the Champions’ League this season caused just as frenzied celebrations as Atletico’s victory over Roma in the UEFA Cup. A derby game is still the most important to win – even if it is only for vocal and colourful support.
 
===== Do you rate their kit? =====
You’ll certainly stand out in the crowd wearing the famous red-and-white shirts. The stripes on the sleeves have been replaced with faded-red that darkens towards the cuffs. The blue shorts are stylish and baggy. Of course, the mark of Gil is on the front of the shirt, but it’s still a cool kit.
 
===== What kind of media coverage do Atletico receive and how are they perceived by the media? =====
It takes something like winning the Liga title or a Gil outburst for Atletico to make the front pages of the Madrid-based newspapers Marca and AS. You will have to dig back into around page 10 to find news on the club and then it is never as interesting or  as outlandish as Real’s coverage.

=== No early salvation for troubled Atletico ===
Jun 27, 2001

By Simon Baskett
MADRID (Reuters)(DS) - "Just one little year in hell" was the slogan the marketing men dreamed up at the beginning of the season to describe Atletico Madrid's first second division campaign in 66 years.
But a year on the phrase has come back to haunt the club who now look to have embarked on a rather more lengthy stay in the distinctly unglamorous lower league of Spanish football.
Promotion was initially thought to be a matter of course for a club that had done the double just four years before and had reached the final of the King's Cup two seasons in succession.
But after a disastrous start to their campaign with just one win from their first seven games even the most sanguine fans began to question how easy it would to extricate themselves from the second division inferno.
The alarm bells began to ring after a defeat against bottom club Universidad Las Palmas, who had only recently clawed their way up from the anonymous depths of the third division.
Out-spoken club president Jesus Gil declared the whole team should be made to swim back from the Canary Islands.
For much of the season relegation looked more likely than a return to the first division.
A late season rally earned them 19 out of a possible 21 points briefly rekindling hopes of salvation, but ultimately it merely prolonged the torment for the club's long-suffering fans.
"It was a tremendous disappointment," said former player and sporting director Paulo Futre. "Our fans don't deserve it. The suffering is over for the moment, but we have lost the fight. It is the biggest blow I have ever received in my sporting career."
Even the traditional cup run offered no comfort.  Atletico, who were bidding for a third final appearance in three years, stumbled out against Zaragoza in the
semifinals after a 2-0 first leg defeat at the Calderon wich was marred by protests from the club's radical fans the "Frente Atletico."
But for Atletico the failure to bounce back to the top flight is only the latest in a long line of disappointments and set backs.
Fans blame the controversial Gil, the arrival of "mercenary" players from abroad, the influence of the Italian coaches Arrigo Sacchi and Claudio Ranieri and just plain bad luck for the failures.

EDGE OF DESPAIR
As one fan said after last week's disappointment: "Atletico have never been a lucky club and if you are an Atletico fan you are used to living on the edge of despair."
Far from ushering in a new era of success the 1996 double proved to be the last flourish before a nose-dive in fortunes that finished with relegation for a club traditionally recognised as the third force in Spanish football behind Real Madrid and Barcelona.
Gil has since become embroiled in a succession of legal wrangles and court-ordered financial investigations that have jeopardised his control of the club, and earned him a brief spell in jail.
Gil is now back in charge, but the legal cases drag on and he insists he will not be forced out.
"Until Atletico are back in the first division and until I demonstrate my innocence I am not going," he says.
Many fans wish he would go sooner, especially as the instability generated by the legal wrangling has also been accompanied by uncertainty on the sporting front.
The team have had an average of nearly three coaches in every season of Gil's 13-year reign as president.
And what has helped make Atletico's failure doubly disappointing is the fact that the club have spent vast sums on high-profile signings since their double triumph.
Close to $60 million dollars was spent on drafting in Brazil's Juninho from Middlesborough, Christian Vieri from Juventus in Italy and Dutchman Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink from Leeds United.
But the spending spree was not accompanied by success on the pitch and the big names have all since departed.
To make matters worse loyal servants such as striker Kiko, who actually agreed to play for the club for nothing this season, and defender Juanma Lopez have been hit by serious injuries.

NEW BLOOD
Kiko has now said he will be leaving, and there is little doubt that an injection of new blood is a pressing priority if the club is to make a more effective claim for promotion next season.
But the emergence of a pair of potential high-flyers from the youth ranks of the club has provided one of the few bright moments in an otherwise gloomy season.
Teenaged sensation Fernando Torres, spearhead of Spain's recent under-18 European championship triumph, and young midfielder Jose Juan Luque have been in outstanding form during the run-in to the end of the season.
And although, in typical Atletico fashion, Torres fractured his shoulder after just four minutes of the cup semifinal against Zaragoza the pair do, at least, provide some hope for the future.
Somewhat surprisingly the appetite of the fans for second division football also appears undimmed.
The club may have got their fingers burned in the second division, but the day after they failed to secure promotion the switchboards were jammed with fans wanting to buy season tickets.
The fact that the inspirational figure of former player Luis Aragones has chosen to turn down the chance to lead
Mallorca into the Champions League and instead return to Atletico for his fifth spell as coach may have something to do with their optimism.
But the relationship between the former player and Gil was a tempestuous one last time round and no one will be surprised if the sparks start to fly once again as the team suffer another year in hell.

=== Of mavericks and monkeys ===
BY PHIL BALL
Feb 11, 2003

My father used to say it, my grandfather used to say it, and no doubt I'll start saying it soon to my son, but it does seem to be the case that there are a lack of 'characters' in the game nowadays.

Of course, it's always worth looking carefully at words that spend their lives being bandied about - and this one certainly qualifies.

Besides, the post-Hornby generation of British football scribes has chosen to use the term 'maverick' for anyone who is deemed to have been vaguely interesting, and there have been the inevitable rash of books on the topic.

A maverick was someone like Peter Osgood, Frank Worthington, George Best, Stan Bowles etc - chaps whose dodgy haircuts and natural flair for the game led them to believe that concepts such as training, tactics, fitness and self-discipline were the territory of limp-wristed conformist wimps.

Most of these mavericks have now managed to ghost reasonably successful autobiographies, and most of these books have their soundbitten moments. They were all great players, were probably all difficult to play and train with, and they all have a decent anecdote or two to pass onto the next generation.

But the true value of these men was in their actual performances, not in their latter-day attempts to make a buck or two to supplement their pensions. Not that one can blame them for this, but the very existence of these books suggests that the 'character' has indeed disappeared from contemporary football, crushed under the sheer weight of training manuals, schools of excellence, mineral water and bed before midnight - no puns intended.

As far as Spain is concerned, I'm no expert on the mavericks of their past, although I've been told of a few personajes - an ironic term that is as close as you can get to the English idea.

Zamora, Kubala, 'Magic' Gonzales, Juanito - but the last one that I can remember is probably Barcelona's forward Stoitchkov - a man so hopelessly pumped-up that he once chased a hare round the Camp Nou for getting in the way and denying him his hat-trick, the poor animal having been released by Atlético Madrid fans just as the Bulgarian was about to curl the ball into the far corner.

And the Atlético Madrid connection is the spur for this week's theme, their goalkeeper being one of the last living examples of this breed, the 'character'. I hesitate to label 'Mono' Burgos a maverick (neither was Stoitchkov), because he trains and sweats along with the rest of his colleagues, is happily married with two children and has yet to be found in his hotel room in the wee small hours with an ex-Miss World.

But Mono (Monkey) Burgos, so called due to his endearing habit of exercising under the crossbar in chimpanzee-like fashion, is a true throwback to the days when footballers spoke to journalists as if they were normal human beings uncensored by the glances of their agents and sponsors. He is fast becoming a cult figure, not only among Atlético's supporters (who have always appreciated a few rough diamonds among their ranks) but right across La Liga's board.

Burgos is in the news at the moment because he let slip a harmless shot by Sevilla's Freddi last Sunday, allowing it to squirm under his body and over the line - although subsequent images suggest that the linesman was wrong to signal a goal.

No matter. The goal was an extraordinary affair, and seemed to take an age. Burgos, who seemed initially unaware that the ball had slipped beneath his bulk, suddenly realised that something was awry, sat up and turned around, but insufficiently to get the ball into his line of vision.

When he realised that a further 90º turn was required, the ball had rolled agonisingly over, or not quite over, the line. The Argentine belongs to the Barthez school of goalkeeping, his occasional public lapses more than compensated for by his frequent brilliance.

Like his French counterpart, he prefers the spectacular leap to the more boring option of good positional sense, but where he differs radically from Barthez is in the image stakes. Germán (his real name) is a huge bear of a man, with an unkempt mane of hair spilling down his back in the manner of a 60s rocker.

“	The rumour mill has it that The Garb will turn out as support for The Stones, or that El Mono will take Jagger's place for a couple of songs, thus fulfilling his dream of a strut alongside his hero, Keith Richards. ”
The appearance fits the man however, since Burgos has his own band, 'The Garb' (an acronym of his initials, Germán Adrian Ramón Burgos) and has developed a fairly tuneful growl halfway between Iggy Pop and Billy Idol. Like the former, he sings stripped down to the waist, and one of his tattoos announces 'Gimme Shelter', a clear reference not to his defenders but to his real heroes who, incidentally, are to open proceedings at the Vicente Calderón in June when Atlético celebrate their centenary.

The Monkey's band are resident in Argentina, since their leader, keen not to be seen as straying too far from the straight and narrow, insists that he only plays and rehearses in summer when he returns to his native land, or when the band come over to Spain. But the rumour mill has it that The Garb will turn out as support for The Stones, or that El Mono will take Jagger's place for a couple of songs, thus fulfilling his dream of a strut alongside his hero, Keith Richards.

Far be it from me to suggest that a person is automatically a 'character' because he sings in a rock band, but Burgos has made Atlético Madrid worth watching again, and gone some considerable way to limiting the damage done by his superiors at the club.

He's a funny, attractive character, who although not quite in the Eric Cantona line of seagull soundbites can nevertheless come out with some classics of his own. His most famous line was after a run of defeats earlier this season: 'Even when you're winning you still have to got the toilet, so when you're losing there's no need to go and shut yourself up in a submarine.' Hmmm.

He also pointed out, in an interview with the magazine 'Don Balón', that 'In football there's poetry, but you have to imagine it yourself.'

Burgos would, however, be horrified by accusations of pretentiousness, since he is working-class and proud of it, and only last week announced that he was happy to stay at Madrid until he retires because he feels that he can identify with the social background of the average Atlético devotee.

German Burgos: I suppose a rock's out of the question?

Cynics might point out that maybe the notoriously thuggish element of Atletico's 'ultras', the Frente Sur, have taken their cue from the craggy 'keeper who laid out Espanyol's Serrano in 1999, when he was keeping goal for Mallorca.  The famous punch, effected with power and subtlety as Serrano was standing in the six-yard box waiting for a corner to be taken, earned Mono Burgos a 12-game ban - a judgement which he nobly accepted on the chin, as it were.

His only justification for the action was that Serrano had been calling him a capullo (prick) all game, but that when he changed the insult to Sudaca (a racist slur term for a South American), he had to take action.

His stoical attitude to the ban moved the press to take his side, and they've been faithful ever since. Burgos now returns the favour with his famous on-field lapses and spontaneous chin-wagging into the post-match microphones.

After the Seville game this last week, his view of the blooper was typically upbeat, again demonstrating a rare appreciation of the fact that football is actually a sport: 'Hey - you have to laugh! I just didn't judge it properly. But who cares? We still drew. We still played well. These things happen. Nothing to have a heart-attack about!'

With further appalling scenes at Sporting Gijon's game against Numancia on Sunday, with several players and stewards conducting themselves like a bunch of psycho thugs, long live characters like Mono Burgos. At least he beats people up for the right reasons.

Growing pains for 'The Kid'
By Gabriele Marcotti

El Niño — The Kid — and it is not hard to see why. With his boyish visage and gangly frame, he resembles a teenager after a growth spurt, a man-child getting acquainted with his new body. To fans of Atlético Madrid, he has always been The Kid, dating back to the August day 11 years ago when, as a ten-year-old, he was one of only three boys to join the club out of 6,000 who showed up for trials.
Today, Torres is probably the best player in Europe never to have played in the European Cup. He is to Atlético fans what Wayne Rooney might have been to the Everton faithful: one part prodigy, one part folk hero, one part native son, one part messiah. It is difficult to overstate what he means to Atlético. He is not only their captain, not only by far their best player, not only their greatest home-grown product; he is the eternal hope of youth, which is why, if he remains at the club, he will forever be The Kid.

“Atlético are the poor team of Madrid, the working-class team,” Torres said. “We don't have money, we rarely win trophies. We exist for other reasons. We give our fans an outlet each weekend to forget about the drudgery of existence and immerse themselves in the club. Of course, that means suffering with the club because we are not rich or powerful, which in some ways is unusual because fans leave their daily suffering to join Atlético's suffering. And yet we go, driven perhaps by hope that one day our fortunes will turn. It's the hope, however irrational. Atlético fans were looking for an idol and when I came along, they adopted me.”

Stop. Reread the above quote. Do those sound like the words of a footballer who turned 21 only eight days ago? Can you imagine Rooney talking in such a way? This is a young man blessed not only with outrageous footballing skills, this is a thinking footballer who in another time might have been called an existentialist.

Reflecting on Real Madrid, the club he turned down at 10 for Atlético, Torres said: “Real are rich and powerful and used to winning, so that's what the fans expect. But that means they are slaves to their success. When they don't win, they can't find happiness.”

Torres has thought about these things because, unlike most professionals, he is a fan. If he were not on the pitch, he would be in the stands. “I made the jump from the stands to the pitch literally in one week,” he said. “One game I was amidst the supporters, the next I was a few yards away, on the pitch. I lived the dream.”

Yet the dream was not always pleasant. There is an adage that suggests that “you should never wed your mistress”, in case the magic shatters against reality. “When you're a fan, you think and dream about your club every day,” he said. “You only see the good parts. When you cross the line and become a player, you see everything. That's not always pretty. But what I found most difficult was dealing with failure as a player as opposed to a fan. As a supporter, you know that if you cheer your heart out, you've done your job. But as a player, you have an extra layer of frustration as, unlike the fans, you can determine the outcome. And that's why defeat hurts much more if you're a player and a fan rather than only a fan.”

Torres had scored 55 league goals before his 21st birthday, but that is a minor part of his game. What really gets scouts excited is his rare combination of size (he is 6ft), strength, pace and technique, all controlled by a creative mind. That is why AC Milan reportedly bid £25 million for him last summer and why, according to the Spanish press, José Mourinho is a huge fan. Atlético have rebuffed the suitors thus far, but there is a sense of the inevitable. The club's financial position remains precarious and, in their hearts, most Atlético fans accept that he will not be around for ever. Torres knows this, too.

“People always ask me about leaving,” he said. “Atlético are a big club, but we don't win much. Elsewhere, I could be competing for important titles. But I have things here which I couldn't have with other teams: my family and friends, my sense of belonging. Do I give that up to chase glory? All the trophies in the world couldn't replace what I have here. Then again, I ask myself if I'm just staying in my comfort zone at Atlético. Would I push myself harder elsewhere? I tell myself there's plenty of time to move if that's what I want, but the truth is, I just don't know. If you ask me the same question in a week, I'll probably give a different answer.”

Did Rooney wrestle with the same issues six months ago? If he did, we may never know. Because Torres is a fan, he is in danger of confusing what Atlético mean to him with who he is. “This is my job, not a hobby,” he said. “Rationally, I know I have to differentiate between the two, but it's very difficult.”

Maybe one day the professional will win out over the fan and he will do what is best for his career, although maybe not for his heart and soul. When this happens, he will move on, win trophies, become very wealthy and attain superstardom. Perhaps he will win the Ballon d'Or and be hailed as one of the greatest. But if this happens he will no longer be The Kid. He will simply be Fernando Torres, the footballer.
