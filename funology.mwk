a new computer (or docker image) is clean with lots of empty space for you to fill up. You don't get attention being misdirected into cognitive loads.

This is why I crave a country lub / library / hotel feel to my home. Empty space (physical and thus mental) for me to play with.

I'm trying to force-create primary keys for time-place combinations, as an obsessive way to persist feelings into long term storage as of they were days

Pasadena constantly listening to radiate to make it feel like California dream like 80s teen culture depicted on sitcoms

I blacklist songs from special times that I don't want diluted

I retained some of my air freshener from the last year of college that I insisted would be a perfect year (academically, soccer and travel)

Photos of myself in places, plus annual albums

Songs by year

Old ringtones

It's sensual to get something clean and unused, even a bash shell with no customization (hence Docker has that new car smell).

Implication: not sure. Clean your apartment, so you experience that joy of populating/dirtying something?

journey vs destination

Joy of discovery

YouTube home page scrolling vs retrospectively looking through onetab urls

The path traversal through the graph full of noise nodes is where the joy of discovery arises. If it's already been curated and instantly appears with no effort, your brain doesn't get the reward that makes it feel excited through the infinite possibility of the unknown

the acquisition process is pleasurable, exciting

getting the end result all in one go (memoization) doesn't do justice to the amount of painstaking effort that went into the aquisition process (e.g. panini stickerbook compilation). 

It's not just me who loves the process. Whoever did it for the panini sticker book compilatin gets a lot of joy from it too.

#programmingtips

Writing new code is fun

Retrofitting new functionality into existing code is not (even if it's my own recreational programs)

Implication: find a way to make modifying code more fun. I think having a data flow diagram with concrete correspondence (method names) is key. Putting it in the readme or or the javadoc header

In fact, work will become more fun and you'll feel more powerful knowing how to enhance existing apps functionality while others are too scared to.

tsort excites me. It does something I didn't think of before but is potentially useful. I need to identify other things that excite me.

Lisp/Prolog does too because of its potential to help me infer new insights.

In both cases what exactly I haven't figured out. But it's a start, and it's still enough to get my imagination going.

I'm into sports for the data aspect, not the athletic part (though it's better people think I'm a jock)

Joy of discovery

reading prose that follows a predictable structure (without revealing the that structure with e.g. headings) is more pleasurable (to normal people) than explicit headings (e.g. girls I asked out - what happened, aftermath etc in a spreadsheet)

The anticipation and fulfillment resonates with the reader.

This is also why Gary Bloom's style of reporage works so well too. He has some signature inflections and you can anticipate he will pay off the arc that he's taken you on.

affordance encourages play, experimentation, discovery

java binaries are not single file binary executables. They need all manner of jre environment variable and classpath setup that requires a shell script (and that shell script is not obvious in how to use compared to a single file binary

implication: apps developed in golang are more fun to use (e.g. selenium web scraping) (though not necessarily to develop)

what makes programming less fun

struggling with incompatible versions (even more so at runtime than compile time since the feedback loop is elongated).

it's the opposite of "it just works" (i.e. immediate feedback)

implication: not sure. You can't avoid it if the framework is that way. THat's one reason I avoid third party libraries even if it's extra work. The runtime may be backward compatible but the dependencu is not.
