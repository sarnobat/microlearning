The problem with me taking on big projects at work is that I need the input information to be given to me in a very concrete form. Most people don't (e.g. Ayub with messaging - I would need to see sample producers and consumers code rather than just a vague English description).

=== decluttering ===

#asp
#decluttering

I think decluttering is hard because an item doesn't change from useful to not useful so quickly. It takes a long time for us to prove that the item no longer has a use (sometimes an entire lifetime).

This is why it's better to buy high quality items. It will be more clear whether they are useful or not.

My slow processing speed makes it take time for me to think through whether I should keep something or not. Months or years

hoarding happens after retaining the lesson of past scarcity when you needed something that you had offloaded.

It's good that I remember the lessons of the past better than most, but I have the opposite extreme problem where I create rules based on freak past situations.

A more balanced combination of selecting/rejecting past lessons would be optimal.

You don't know what it means in the context of the single model you are trying to capture. This is why I struggle at work when non visual people illustrate things on a whiteboard. Are they illustrating control flow, data flow, connectivity or some other kind of relationship?

OOP encourages (mutable) shared state

you can't pass the output of one OO subsystem to another as easily as you can pass the output of a data flow subsystem to another since you can't represent the entirety of that subsystem's result textually (well, you can with json but no OO program does this ...unless it is distributed and sent over a wire)

in other words, function (de)composition is possible, but object (de)composition is effectively impossible.

This is why I hate OOP.  You can't model components of a system precisely. All you have is vague english prose to describe pieces (which is difficult for autistic people)

to blend in with neurotypicals  who don't mean things literally (e.g. "have a safe journey", "have a good sleep", "how are you", "how was your weekend", "may this year bless you with xyz", bless you) you basically have to avoid deep thinking of parsing what they are literally saying. Basically you have to be superficial and turn your brain off. You just have to interpret their voice as incoherent sounds but be thrilled they are giving you attention (which to be fair is nice)

if you want to be useful to me, reminding me to put on a belt before leaving home would have helped me a lot more. I've just lost an entire day of my life from not doing that today.

Hi Stephan,

I'd like to follow up on what you said in the new hire training that causes last minute pull requests:

"If you estimate anything that seems too high, the manager is never going to say 'do it faster' but they will challenge you by saying 'break it down'."

This sounds reasonable but in my career I've repeatedly encountered situations where my estimate is more accurate when non-itemized  with an analytical model, but instead goes by coarse-grained empirical evidence (i.e. past experience). For example, "last time I had to make a build change that affects 3 apps, it took me X days. Therefore, to the best of my knowledge, my 'gut feeling' is that the task in this upcoming sprint in this going to take 2X days." 

If I'm asked why it will take 2X days with itemized subtasks, I can't identify those because there are so many and they are different each time (from a team lunch to a scrum running too long, to VPN not working, to needing to help a colleague, to something code related that you didn't know beforehand, to another unplanned task getting injected into the sprint, to relying on offshore colleagues to give you information but they are not responding to messages).

When I pointed this out the  "Burden of proof fallacy" to a previous manager the conversation got heated and I had no choice but to keep quiet and accept that I may get in trouble depending on what kind of mood the manager would be in whenever it came to a head.

(e.g. feeling lighter)
How do I feel (difference in eating pizza vs lettuce)
not evaluating/rating yourself (which I'm always doing): 
if I'm at the library, is it closer to how I feel at work or at home (regarding strangers evaluating me)
concentrating more on activity than proficiency/competency
avoidance of judgment
with a cat
around people (e.g. Ratnesh) - trauma ( past experience), fear of ridicule (reflex from how dad was)
But if I try to relax, I'm ignoring others attempts to connect with me
Need to demonstrate that I am more worthy of respect than the ridicule that my dad would subject me to for being my uninhibited self.

a book that you are interrupted from reading a bit of carries a state. Thus it is easier to pick up when you have a small amount of free time.

Reading a pdf requires you to set up the state again by opening the file and going to the right page. I don't function that way since I'm slow.

Interesting thought I had : Sports (like WWE and Soccer) are a 'Turing Complete' community.  It's like how in Comp Sci, a Turning Complete Machine/Language can solve any computational problem, no matter how complex, in finite runtime, instead of being an 'undecidable' problem. 

Likewise, human cultural stuff, like sports, religion, etc. provide a paradigm for interpreting everything else in society.  Kinda like how the Royal Rumble is our screen saver during our conversations.  We can have a convo about random topics, i.e. dating, career, etc. Then our brains can instantly make connections between the Royal Rumble and the subject matter at hand, i.e. 'Hey, Triple H's relationship with Stephanie McMahon reminds me of this dating dynamic with Indian women!'

#indirection
#worseisbetter

Jenkins, and almost all "frameworks", are cases of "better is worse."

In aiming to make things easier for less skilled people, the designers make things indirect and non-trivial (or impossible) to map to the underlying functionality that more skilled people (power users) need.

e.g. windows OS instead of a unix-like OS
spring framework compiler instead of the java compiler
jenkins instead of a shell script + interpreter
webmin?
quarkus instead of kubernetes?

This is why you can guarantee that for every new technology like kubernetes that gets popularized, there will be an unwelcome wrapper (the "do Y so you don't have to do X" antipattern). The committee that carefully thought out the standardization of the underlying platform gets buried underneath an "easier-to-use" indirection.

I have yet to find a technology that made the irresponsible one a substitute for the pure one. Windows is one, but that's for casual users and not technologists. Anyone who is in a technology career should not waste their time with using the wrapper. It is for people who learn quickly and forget quickly.

Oh yeah walking on soggy muddy leaves during wet seasons in the UK disgusted me. Thankfully in the US, sidewalks etc. are cleaned.

Also I can't eat foods with non-complementary textures in the same meal (crunchy vegetables with mushy beans for example)

Restaurants playing music so I can't talk to friends is so counterproductive

Yep, noisy rude inconsiderate neighbors have been a recurring theme in my adulthood

Even people laughing really loud for something that is barely funny is like getting elecrocuted for me

Yes women's perfume feels like a toxic chemical to me, the kind of reaction you get when you are in danger

That said, I love unhealthy things like gasoline, permanent markers

People spraying perfume on their clothes rather than their bodies offends me for some reason.

Strangely, stairs are easy for me. Though I find it tiring and always climb 2 steps at a time. 1 feels too slow and taking extra energy

I hate camping because of the moisture, itchiness thinking there are insects. In fact I'm not too crazy about beaches and sand sticking to the moisture between my toes

AS is a “pervasive developmental disability.” That is, people with AS may often appear or act younger than others of the same age. Children with AS often show delays in multiple areas of functioning, such as gross or fine motor coordination, social skills, or executive functioning (organization, prioritizing, and follow-through). However, they also continue to develop and mature—on their own time-table. Some people with AS may have specific gifts in mathematics, literature, or the arts. There is strong evidence that such superstars as Vincent Van Gogh, Emily Dickinson, Albert Einstein, code-breaker Alan Turing, and musician Glen Gould, among many others, all had Asperger Syndrome. Today, too, there are adults with AS who are successful as professors, lawyers, physicians, artists, authors, and educators. For this reason, many people with AS, and professionals who know them, consider AS a difference rather than a disability. The brains of people with AS seem to process information and sensory stimuli differently than the brains of neurotypical (NT) people. This can be a source of difficulty, but it can also be a strength. For example, people with AS are often very good at noticing visual details or remembering facts, skills that are useful in many professions. On the other hand, the same people may be too perfectionistic, become too obsessed with details, or have so much trouble seeing the big picture that they cannot complete a project.

To oversimplify what the problem is, you would need to familiarize yourself with Empathising Systemising theory (E-S, developed by Simon Baron-Cohen).  Some people are Systemising in their thinking, in focusing on objects, rather than people, in deep discussions (i.e. men, ppl w/ Aspergers, STEM engineers).  Others are Emphasizing, or focusing on people instead (i.e. women, artists, dancers, creative types, Sex-In-The-City type NYC alpha-socialites etc).   My dad is extremely S, while my mom is extremely E.  My dad is an hardwareEngineer-turned-manager, my mom is a special ed teacher. That does not match well for a marriage.

AS is a “pervasive developmental disability.” That is, people with AS may often appear or act younger than others of the same age. Children with AS often show delays in multiple areas of functioning, such as gross or fine motor coordination, social skills, or executive functioning (organization, prioritizing, and follow-through). However, they also continue to develop and mature—on their own time-table. Some people with AS may have specific gifts in mathematics, literature, or the arts. There is strong evidence that such superstars as Vincent Van Gogh, Emily Dickinson, Albert Einstein, code-breaker Alan Turing, and musician Glen Gould, among many others, all had Asperger Syndrome. Today, too, there are adults with AS who are successful as professors, lawyers, physicians, artists, authors, and educators. For this reason, many people with AS, and professionals who know them, consider AS a difference rather than a disability. The brains of people with AS seem to process information and sensory stimuli differently than the brains of neurotypical (NT) people. This can be a source of difficulty, but it can also be a strength. For example, people with AS are often very good at noticing visual details or remembering facts, skills that are useful in many professions. On the other hand, the same people may be too perfectionistic, become too obsessed with details, or have so much trouble seeing the big picture that they cannot complete a project.

Some Aspies (not all) have problems with their working memories. I'm one of them. What this means is that if you tell me your phone number, I'll have forgotten the first-three digits by the time you get to the last. If I don't write it down as you're telling to me, there's no way I'll remember it. (I've forgotten numbers in the ten seconds its taken to walk across the room to get a pen.)

I'm very good at compensating for this. (I write everything down.) But multitasking is impossible for me. If I have to switch back and forth between two tasks, I'm sunk.

When they are sure they are right they don’t seek further information (like when I get lost navigating - it’s only because I am sure I know and don’t bother to look something up, not when I am unsure and look at directions)

1) attack the hard stuff first - at the beginning of each day, list: What are the two hardest things I need to do today? and Who do I need to talk to in order to get things done faster?
2) budget time to say hello to 2 people per day. It can be anytime during the day, but budget the time and do it. Getting to know people casually will pay dividends over time



you can say after a standup..."Hey I was part of the standup and new here. I am working on xxx and trying to meet my new colleagues. What are you working on?" Exchange messages for a few minute

The first few times may be uncomfortable for you. Try at least three times before judging whether it's useful or not. After the three times, let Katee and I know how it went

the fact that siva asked in my exit interview if I thought I deserved the 2/5 rating, and that I could have filed a complaint rather than explain to me why he gave me that rating tells me it was reckless. In hindsight had I contested it I'd have had less to lose - I could have transferred internally more easily. But I was so docile and never confrontational that I just accepted it and felt that if someone else thought it, I must deserve it. Obviously I gave too much credit to others not realizing how clueless some "smart" people really are.

Implication: nothing to feel aggrieved about. Just don't feel bad about how others judge you. There are managers who don't know what they're doing (i.e. incompetent middle managers).

Debugging baseline authentication call not working (turns out it was expired) - Ivan just told me which method to call, his suggestions on service calls not working were not the issue. I had to do all the grunt work.

When he gave feedback, it would take me time in between each suggestion to do what he said so having just 30 mins of his time was not applicable to this kind of situation.

AS is a “pervasive developmental disability.” That is, people with AS may often appear or act younger than others of the same age. Children with AS often show delays in multiple areas of functioning, such as gross or fine motor coordination, social skills, or executive functioning (organization, prioritizing, and follow-through). However, they also continue to develop and mature—on their own time-table. Some people with AS may have specific gifts in mathematics, literature, or the arts. There is strong evidence that such superstars as Vincent Van Gogh, Emily Dickinson, Albert Einstein, code-breaker Alan Turing, and musician Glen Gould, among many others, all had Asperger Syndrome. Today, too, there are adults with AS who are successful as professors, lawyers, physicians, artists, authors, and educators. For this reason, many people with AS, and professionals who know them, consider AS a difference rather than a disability. The brains of people with AS seem to process information and sensory stimuli differently than the brains of neurotypical (NT) people. This can be a source of difficulty, but it can also be a strength. For example, people with AS are often very good at noticing visual details or remembering facts, skills that are useful in many professions. On the other hand, the same people may be too perfectionistic, become too obsessed with details, or have so much trouble seeing the big picture that they cannot complete a project.

AS is a “pervasive developmental disability.” That is, people with AS may often appear or act younger than others of the same age. Children with AS often show delays in multiple areas of functioning, such as gross or fine motor coordination, social skills, or executive functioning (organization, prioritizing, and follow-through). However, they also continue to develop and mature—on their own time-table. Some people with AS may have specific gifts in mathematics, literature, or the arts. There is strong evidence that such superstars as Vincent Van Gogh, Emily Dickinson, Albert Einstein, code-breaker Alan Turing, and musician Glen Gould, among many others, all had Asperger Syndrome. Today, too, there are adults with AS who are successful as professors, lawyers, physicians, artists, authors, and educators. For this reason, many people with AS, and professionals who know them, consider AS a difference rather than a disability. The brains of people with AS seem to process information and sensory stimuli differently than the brains of neurotypical (NT) people. This can be a source of difficulty, but it can also be a strength. For example, people with AS are often very good at noticing visual details or remembering facts, skills that are useful in many professions. On the other hand, the same people may be too perfectionistic, become too obsessed with details, or have so much trouble seeing the big picture that they cannot complete a project.

Weaknesses

I'm not good at doing what I'm told

So I will probably not be able to piggyback off a senior partner or mentors hard work like some book authors, researchers or young managers

I'm better at going where there is no path and leaving a trail

failing fast is another way of saying get more cycles in - i.e. increase your cpu frequency so you can do more attempts in a fixed unit of time.

in 'mind performance hacks' they call this overclocking

It's the real way for a child to get ahead too. Iterate more frequently so you gain experience / deliberate practice and develop a richer mental model than classmates who are your competitors

AS is a “pervasive developmental disability.” That is, people with AS may often appear or act younger than others of the same age. Children with AS often show delays in multiple areas of functioning, such as gross or fine motor coordination, social skills, or executive functioning (organization, prioritizing, and follow-through). However, they also continue to develop and mature—on their own time-table. Some people with AS may have specific gifts in mathematics, literature, or the arts. There is strong evidence that such superstars as Vincent Van Gogh, Emily Dickinson, Albert Einstein, code-breaker Alan Turing, and musician Glen Gould, among many others, all had Asperger Syndrome. Today, too, there are adults with AS who are successful as professors, lawyers, physicians, artists, authors, and educators. For this reason, many people with AS, and professionals who know them, consider AS a difference rather than a disability. The brains of people with AS seem to process information and sensory stimuli differently than the brains of neurotypical (NT) people. This can be a source of difficulty, but it can also be a strength. For example, people with AS are often very good at noticing visual details or remembering facts, skills that are useful in many professions. On the other hand, the same people may be too perfectionistic, become too obsessed with details, or have so much trouble seeing the big picture that they cannot complete a project.

==== How did you find out about your diagnosis? At what age? Academic background? (Sridhar) ====

Age 31
after losing several jobs for poor performance, I spoke to a psychologist for advice
But almost missed it completely until I said near the end "oh, I have a brother who has Asperger's syndrome" then she said bingo
Cornell Master's Computer Science

==== What are some challenges you face during employment? How did you overcome them? (Sridhar, Wes) ====

Slow to finish work
Cannot switch between tasks
Cannot read text, need diagrams
Auditory retention is weak
Afraid to repeatedly ask for help

I haven't solved the issues and been happily employed. However:
Spoke to recruiter before interviewing
Spoke to manager after receiving offer
Spoke to HR after joining
Spoke to manager after HR formally communicated to them

Luck - in my current job I don't need to ask for help because I'm more senior, or I happened to have friendly colleagues

To oversimplify what the problem is, you would need to familiarize yourself with Empathising Systemising theory (E-S, developed by Simon Baron-Cohen).  Some people are Systemising in their thinking, in focusing on objects, rather than people, in deep discussions (i.e. men, ppl w/ Aspergers, STEM engineers).  Others are Emphasizing, or focusing on people instead (i.e. women, artists, dancers, creative types, Sex-In-The-City type NYC alpha-socialites etc).   My dad is extremely S, while my mom is extremely E.  My dad is an hardwareEngineer-turned-manager, my mom is a special ed teacher. That does not match well for a marriage.

I read books hierarchically, not linearly.
 
I look for a page that grabs my attention, or search in the contents or index, and try and find the part that is relevant to me. 
 
Ways to 'grab my attention"
 
(-) excerpts from the main text (e.g. quotes in DK publishing books)
(-) summary lines (Dalle Carnegie)
(-) pictures
 
Books without pictures make the 'grabs my attention" part impossible
 
Implication: books without any hierarchical nodes are not worth trying to read. Screen them out of any buying process. Simple chapters are not enough (like .eg. buy once cry once)

Lossy DECISIONS rather than non-lossy categorization-without-decision is better. It prunes your search space more cleanly

(Eg digitize vs papers)
