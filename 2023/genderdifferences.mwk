Men's arms rotate slightly inwards while women's arms rotate slightly outwards. These rotation differences have enabled men to aim and throw more accurately, while women's splayed elbows give them a wider, more stable position for carrying babies. One interesting difference is that women tend to keep their arms more open when they are around men they find attractive and are likely to fold their arms across their breasts around aggressive or unattractive men.

I think both introverted men and women generally have it worse than extroverts. Some for shared reasons and yes I'm sure there are other factors that are gender specific.

You've listed some of the cons for men. But while women can get away with being quiet at times, it doesn't work so much when you're an adult with a career - you're expected to be chatty and emotive. A woman can feel held back more at work compared to an equally quiet guy on the team. Sometimes there's a subtle, automatic confidence in someone because they're a man. In a more social setting I'm sure it could go the other way.

This is so true! Being quiet as a woman can sometimes be harder because of the automatic confidence that men receive. I feel like women have to be more extroverted to achieve that. I have had these difficulties in social and work settings.

I think they just have more opportunities to do extroverted things than men
For example, even a shy girl probably gets a lot of party invites. Girls are seen as valuable for the party even if they're just standing around and doing nothing. It's the same reason clubs let girls in for free.
Now an introverted guy, who tf would be inviting him to parties? A guy standing around in a corner at a party is seen as a creep.
So introverted guys have less value in social outings. Girls have value solely for existing, so it doesn't matter if they're introverted or not.

For women, it's more culturally acceptable to be introverted, although it's getting harder and harder. Being shy used to be idealized [for women]. On the other hand, there's the expectation to be social and vivacious and a good hostess and to make other people feel comfortable. It's a matter of finding which available gender role suits your style.

An MBTI survey revealed that males are slightly more likely to be introverted, but the difference was very small.

Males are more introverted, quieter and deeper than women based on experience and scientific studies. Males tend to have black matters on their brains and testosterone which inhibit them from expressing themselves as good as girls and drive them to be less social than their female counterparts. Women, on the other side, tends to be more social and outgoing, and usually talk more than men although there are also exceptions.

Conversation with my female friends can be of anything. They're really easygoing and use talking to get to socializing. They can be smart and good in studies but they seldom enjoy discussing about deep topics and would rather focus on anime, boys and gossips."

I guess one cause or effect (not sure which) of males pursuing females is that females get interrupted more, and so don't get alone time to think deeply.

Mulan is preparing to meet with the matchmaker, so she is trying to remember the qualities expected of her as a woman. Her mother dresses her in bright feminine colors, including red, pink, and white, as well as caking her face with makeup to enhance her physical appearance. In doing so, Mulan is transformed into a typical feminine woman.

When Mulan arrives at the training camp, she tries her best to be "one of the guys" by deepening her voice, dressing as the males do, and engaging in physical comradery. Mushu explains to Mulan that she must be "tough" and "strutt" with confidence if she is to act like the men surrounding her. When Mulan is instructed by Mushu to punch one of the other soldiers, it is viewed as the beginning stage of friendship. Therefore, violence is presented as an appropriate way for men to exchange affection.

When someone tries to calm or incapacitate a guy it's much more socially acceptable to use a believable amount of force ,  such as punching him, knocking him out with a weapon, or beating him senseless. But since Wouldn't Hit a Girl tends to be in effect, the next best option is to just grab her. But even that can gather Unfortunate Implications: there are few real-life holds that can be used on women without being (at least a bit) reminiscent of sexual harassment.note  So writers might resort to the Standard Female Grab Area as a less graphic shortcut to incur a plot development.

But are women as beholden to the phallic member of their male brethren?

But really I think that women are more attracted to the romance and desire inherent in the stories ... a penis just happens to be involved - perhaps this is one more instance where a man is incidental to the true lusty lure.

women don't necessarily understand the primal sexual urge that propels the male head(s).

The appeal of visual porn for men and written erotica for women reveals the differences between the needs of the two genders. Men are viscerally turned on by the mere sight of female skin - foreplay be damned - show us a bagina, and we're 95% of the way to steamy liftoff.

Women say "hold on ... talk to me, hold me, tell me I'm desirable, touch me all over, not just on the naughty bits. Let's make this performance a full-length feature, not just a 30 second commercial break."

To be in possession of a bagina confers automatic membership to an exclusive club, no boys allowed.

There are pluses and minuses to Bagina Club membership, but the real bottom line of the clique is that its members secretly rule the world, a sort of  The DaVinci Code.

Men have no Penile Club to belong to where they share genital inside information with their comrades ... no "I've got penile cramps"... no, "I'm a week late", no, "is it hot in here, or am I just having a hot flash?". NOPE, nothin'.

Women share the mystery and glory of their private parts as cooperative partners with other women. They carry spare tampons and pads for those stranded in distress. They nod compassionately and offer Midol to those in cramped discomfort. They visit restrooms (something they call "Powder Rooms") together.

The closest men come to this clubby sort of atmosphere resides in the urinal line-up where we huddle in straight lines, hand-on-member, looking bored into a cold, tiled wall 6 inches from our nose ... sure, 6 inches is really more like 3 inches, but we boys have difficulty determining true length. Talking is frowned upon while urinating because it just feels too intimate to be chatting to another guy when you have a penis in your hand.

abusive language directed at women might encompass unladylike sexual behavior, such as whore, slut, skank, pussy, cunt, dyke, twat, etc. or might compare women to sub-human animals, such as bitch, chick, dog, cow, horse, pig, porker. Meanwhile, insults for men largely stem from allusions to weakness and femininity, either from references to women or stereotypically feminine men, such as pussy, cunt, sissy, wimp, poofter, motherfucker, cocksucker, son of a bitch. While there are slurs that describe male genitals, these tend to be generally less offensive than female genitals and stick to describing non-sexual characteristics, such as mistreating others or stupidity, e.g. asshole, dick, prick, bonehead, knob, etc. This is pretty different from similar words used to refer to women.

In data from New Zealand,[2] it was noted that women tended to compliment each other considerably more often than men complimented each other. This statistic is reflected in further data that showed that women gave two-thirds of the recorded compliments and received three-quarters of them. 

women tended to compliment other women more often than they complimented men, and more often than men complimented either each other or women

discrepancies in male-male and female-female complimentary language may be due to differences in perception concerning the purpose of compliments. The hypothesis is that women use compliments to build affiliations, while men use compliments to make evaluative judgments.

female linguistic behavior to the purpose of rapport-building, so, assuming compliments are being used as such a means, the data of complimentary language between women seems to suggest this tendency to create and strengthen affiliations is strongest between women.

Men are expected to be strong and aggressive, women are expected to be docile and deferential, and so the language that men and women use, or have used against them, is often subtly biased along gender lines, even if we don't overtly notice it. 

at women who aren't exactly adhering to social expectations of deferential, non-threatening femininity.

"Bitch" is one of the more well-known slurs for women that's partway through a reclamation effort that's battling a long history of invective use against women. It still packs a fairly offensive punch, even when used by women towards other women

Deborah James' 1998 revealing study of gender-linked derogatory terms for men and women 

women are insulted through references to sexual morals or being compared to sub-human entities, while men are insulted by being associated with women and weakness/femininity.

So, abusive language directed at women might encompass unladylike sexual behavior, such as whore, slut, skank, pussy, cunt, dyke, twat, etc. or might compare women to sub-human animals, such as bitch, chick, dog, cow, horse, pig, porker.
