it looks like Manuwela is into virtual networking (which is impressive but that's largely a consequence of being younger and being where the new jobs are, like me in IoT)

If I was to tell her, like I told Poorvi, "I feel insecure whenever I think of your career compared to mine" I would get confused laughing look with her saying "Why?!" same way I would if someone older than me said that to me (and Aravind K sort of did with my degree). They are just in a different circle of competency to you

People's apparent success is inversely proportional to how frequently you observe them (now that I think about Poorvi trying to go to grad school in the US, I see it's not all rosy). One lesson from this is to keep your long term targets in mind and keep progressing them, even if you're not seeing results. This is how a good business operates too. Not by quarter (which is equivalent to paycheck-to-paycheck).
The most reliable demo is a static mockup. But that bypasses a critical feedback loop in building the real product.

Looking around an Indian function, there are many people I could feel superior to. But the truth is anyone has unlimited potential if given the same opportunities and resources

In fact, the internal competition isn't even intended to rank people as much as it is to pull the entire community up.

My need to feel superior is actually just to not feel inferior. If I am actually superior, I will not reject others. 

That's why the people I'm closest to are people who I am above on the totem pole at that period in time (at other periods the order maybe be switched such as murali and kunal)

Females are just a backdrop to males' quest to pass on genes.

They have a temporary beauty that is merely bait for males to pursue them. That means-to-an-end beauty diminishes once they are too old to act as a conduit for producing offspring. Those females then move onto more important things in their life like being good mothers.

I say this not as a chavinist that thinks women don't deserve respect. On the contrary, I say it as a single struggling male who is made to feel inadequate to females because of the extraordinary desirability they command (and that males never have an analogue of). That extraordinary beauty is not something to feel worthless against. Rather, it's to make you try as hard as possible to chase them even if you are not an aggressive male by nature. Misery-driven motivation (just like I use the toxic misery strategy I use when unemployed trying to find my next job, preventing me from slacking)

As someone who felt inferior to good-looking women for a long time, nothing changed for me until I figured out that... women are people, too.

My mind had reduced beautiful women to concepts or mental projections that I had to game, strategize and scheme around. I had given beautiful women and what they meant for me so much meaning that I could no longer see them for who they really were.
It wasn't until I got out of my own head for a brief moment - that I saw them for people. Beautiful women are just as insecure as you and I from time to time. They too have problems. They too have fears. They too are looking for happiness and meaning. They too want a safe harbor on life's rough seas.

There are a few reasons why boys might feel jealous of pretty girls.

They might feel like they don't measure up. Boys are often socialized to believe that their worth is tied to their physical appearance. When they see a pretty girl, they might feel like they don't look as good, and that this makes them less valuable.
They might feel like they can't compete for attention. Pretty girls often get a lot of attention from boys. This can make boys feel like they can't compete, and that they'll never be good enough for the girl they like.
They might feel like they're not good enough for the girl they like. Pretty girls are often seen as being out of reach for boys. This can make boys feel like they're not good enough for the girl they like, and that she'll never be interested in them.
It's important to remember that jealousy is a normal emotion. Everyone feels jealous sometimes. However, if jealousy is causing you to feel bad about yourself or to act in a negative way, it's important to talk to someone about it. A therapist can help you understand your feelings and develop healthy coping mechanisms.

If it wasn’t for the green card longing and anticlimax, I would have seen the day of becoming an architect as the ultimate goal.

I know better that life is not worse before, or better after. It’s your feeling of being inadquate from within that is making you long for those as a cure for the inadequacy

it’s better to acknowledge (but not be complacent with) your strengths and take advantage of those. Ketki is more mature than any indian about knowing this. Whites are better than indians this way.

Mom, on the other hand, says it hollowly. She tells me to feel it, but her real insecurities come out when something good happens to someone else (it’s ok, there’s no easy solution and I’ll be like her at her age too. It’s just that she should acknowledge her poor handling of it too instead of pretending she is above it).

I’ve “achieved” green card and citizenship before radhika, manuwela and arun but I am afraid of the day that they will reach parity with me and fear my inadequacy attacking me hugely that day.

I wish I could just remember that they got their marriages, babies and job titles partly through being more “capable” but also because they had access to resources I did not. Same way I had access to a fast track green card and home ownership thanks to my parents’ UK immigration.

But above all, remember it’s good to have peers who are better than you. They will pull you up. Nachi having a home in Milpitas is a data point so you can buy the right home too.

At the end of your life, the other people's jobs titles won't matter. You'll have accomplished something that will be valued in absolute terms, not in comparison to others. In fact, after retirement it doesn't even matter what you achieved. It's no longer current

In fact your younger cousins will still be working and be higher in status (at best you'll have some personal projects that continue to be used in the public domain). This is also what celebrities valuable for their youth go through.

The group of investors who are outperforming at any given time is constantly changing. It might be your friend one month, your coworker the next, and that pesky cousin six months from now. But you don't know that, though, because it just looks like more and more people are doing better than you.

Here's something I've come to realize over my 25 years in the finance industry: People can't shut up when they happen to own the EV stock that's up 400%. But they never say a word about the biotech that went to zero.

ask someone how who looks young but is senior how they give off the vibe of being senior and they'll respond "because of my greying hair?" (This happened with rajesh kanapalli)

Implication: they don't see what you find amazing about them. They'll only see their downside. Much like I do

Even people in other professions might feel inferior to engineers (e.g. Teju)

and parents with government jobs compare how many patients their peers have. Even the smallest difference generates a diff

we all compare to people in our vicitinity.

(research)

Women typically want the financial security that older men are more likely to provide, but that doesn't mean they also want their old, saggy skin. In other words, if you're a guy in his mid-40s with the face of a young thirty-something, it's definitely working in your favor.

fair complexions in women are considered the ideal aesthetic because they symbolize purity and goodness. Men with darker complexions, on the other hand, are considered more dangerous and mysterious, which provides a sexy allure for many women.


Women lose their skin-protecting hormone much"faster"than men.

Have you ever noticed that men tend to suffer from severe acne more than women? There is a scientific reason for this.
Not only do men have bigger pores than women, they also have higher sebum (oil) production than women. This is due to the fact that men have higher amounts of testosterone in the body.
While struggling with acne breakouts is the worst, there is a benefit to all this oil production'it keeps the skin healthy, supple and hydrated. Hydrated skin reduces the appearance of wrinkles because it plumps up the skin.

In women, the breakdown of estrogen is associated with dry skin and wrinkles (see claim: "Aging is associated with declining levels of several hormones, including estrogen"). This degradation begins around age 30 and drops more quickly around age 40.

Testosterone is what makes a man's skin thicker and oilier compared to that of a woman. Although men also see testosterone begin to dip in their 30s, this drop is far more gradual compared to women's loss of estrogen.

I am guessing that Indians get a lot of their knowledge from (unsubstantiated) word of mouth. They just assume everything they are told is true (e.g. 'at Intuit we use Spring by default). It's very hard even at a peer reviewed journal level to believe bold generalized claims without critical thinking.

implication: don't think that indian peers are 'in the know" more than you, they may well end up no better off than you in this regard (e.g. leaving Cisco for Paypal)

People I feel inferior to

Those who've made money through startup acquisitions
People at FANGMAN companies
Managers or staff engineers the same age as me or younger
Married people


People I would feel inferior I was one of these:

Living outside America
Living outside Silicon Valley
Not working in IT
Contractors
QA
PhD students
College students who haven't landed a job


Implication: when you can't win, stop competing and play a different game

Ladder of envy is really a Circle of envy

Junior engineers envies senior who envies the lead who envies the director who envies the VP who envies the executive who envies the CEO who envies the owner who envies customers who envy the junior engineer who works there.

If Poorvi thought like me, she'd be envious that Akhill is in America before her, and not being able to go to an elite college like some do. And by the time she finishes grad school in the US and gets a job, she will be a bit older and not as slim even if she's gained those.

Impllication: stop feeling inferior to her.

alternative viewpoint
if I have children later than others it won't be as bad as it sounds
when others children have graduated college and have now settled into a job, my children will be the flavor of the month with their college admission etc.
also, I'll know what the target is and look to beat it (it's like having the 2nd leg of a soccer cup tie at home, or playing a world cup group match after your rival - you know what you need to do to beat their score, like Argentina did to Brazil in 1978)

In the 1930s, believe it or not, men's nipples were considered just as taboo as women's nipples.

Think about what you have next time you feel jealous of how sensual women are

Accepting that the world is full of chaos and not narratives that are conspired against you makes you more resilient, less envious and ultimately more successful.

I'm not joking: I have an inferiority complex to everyone of my demographic (thanks a lot Facebook). I was looking to feel better about myself, and seeing people who show off a lot but still not actually better than me was just what I needed.

Now it's addictive and I can't stop seeking a regular self esteem boost. There are bigger losers than me

Aksu

Discounting what my admirable results are

Aksu didn't work THAT hard

It wasn't 
Kill difficult

Enjoyed the process

What is easy for me is not easy for someone else

Your way of functioning has a purpose in life
Someone has to do it

The challenges you are experiencing are more common than you think

The strengths I have do not help me find a partner, but they help for other things

Accept your weaknesses
(Like a creative non technical person does)

You will find other meaningful things easier

Metacognition
Thinking about thinking
Catch yourself comparing and understand that it's natural but not necessary

Not everyone has the same metabolism that they are born with
They didn't do anything to deserve it

Same with me being less social than Sachin and alone

I'm not missing everything, just one thing

Anxiety about having a partner is what everyone experiences

Your difficulties and another person's difficulties may be different in nature and point in life when they occur

I'm looking at other people my age seeing how easy it is for me
Another guy may be be envying me being single because he and his wife have problems

Ignorance of someone else's reality makes it look blissful to you

Attractive girls may look like they have a perfect marriage but their husbands may always be on edge and trying to keep her happy

Big bang theory

Penny feels inferior to Raj's sister who is dating Leonard after Penny broke up with him, because she is just a waitress while she is a scientist (or lawyer?).

Implication: others will find things to be inferior to you about even if you don't see them, or even if they don't make any logical sense. Others' thoughts are flawed too (in your favor). People like Murali, Zafar and Ram say how well I'm doing.

Equalizer

Anyone who does not live on the west Coast simply cannot be in a better place than me. Just look at the temperature range (so don't feel inferior to ex!)

And any Indian simply cannot compete with the quality of Indian restaurants in the Bay Area (not even New Jersey, I know first hand. And definitely not Los Angeles)

There are simply too many pretty girls in this world to have a total ordering. This is apparent when you open TikTok (abundance).

Implication: even if you feel inferior to certain beautiful girls you know (or successful relatives etc.), just remember there are too many potential competitors in the world to keep measuring yourself against. It's not worth the effort to ever bother figuring out where you rank in that giant pool. You'll never meet the majority of them so the few that you do are of no more consequence.

1st generation indians may have payed off their loan with no help but they didn't have a mortgage like you.

If they were from as rich a background as me then they would do likewise.

And if they were sensible like me they wouldn't pick an MBA based on price.

what's best for them is not best for me, so don't compare how self sufficient they are in paying off their own degree while I got mom's help. It saves both me and mom money if she pays it for me. The price of ego would have cost more money.
