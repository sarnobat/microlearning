Thinking about someone like James Loder who I don't see any weaknesses in, he doesn't dwell on being worse than others at non-core competencies.

But it helps when you aren't bombarded with images of others glorifying their success.

In the case of attractive Indian females, it might be the opposite: they are desensitized to others success because it's an endless parade. I guess I'm half-way there.

If I try to be the best version of myself, the innovations that will occur in the future economy will give me advantages.

This is of more use than the the alternate scenario whereby I feel envious of new developments that benefit others but not me (e.g. pandemic allowing people to work in cheaper cities like Atlanta when my ultimate dream is to get to stay in California nad have a house in a good school district).

But be careful about doubling down with post-rationalization bias / sour grapes. California climate is indeed better but if I insist I will never go anywhere with worse climate i may forbid myself from ever going somewhere that is better in light of new developments (e.g. partner studying in Texas, Texas starting to have nonstop flights to India, getting a job at Google in North Carolina, or Texas turning into a blue state or wife getting a fantastic job in Boston).

Similarly, it's not that easy to prove that Manuwela is better than me.

The reality is, we are better than each other at certain things. And the fact she is a dance teacher while I'm a soccer fanatic doesn't make her superior. She touches more people with that hobby because women find interaction with people more rewarding than men.

the locality problem

no one place will have everything. (in some cases two desirable things are even polar opposites).

The west coast is practically the closest thing to paradise ("sun, sea, surf"). We don't have Harsh winters (sun), formal dress codes (surf), early mornign starts. But in reality we go to work just like people on the east coast, offices are not that different. And the scenery isn't as beautiful as the east coast because it is desert. The east coast has lush greenery.

On the other hand It may seem like everything is more within easy access on the east coast (e.g. getaway to Florida), but in reality it's rare to venture outside your city. Even within a megalopolis do people from Philadelphia really become any more familar with the layout of New York than people from the West Coast?

THe boringness/monotone of a locality is analogous in reason to local news being boring. Things are not eventful when you don't have a huge mass to cherry pick sensational news stories from in every broadcast.

When you feel Poorvi is better than you

(-) Remember what it was like when you thought you'd be better than her (e.g. when I thought she wouldn't go to a top college in the US for financial reasons)
(-) Think if others feel inferior to that person (e.g. is Jaya inferior to Poorvi? Would it matter?)
(-) Tell yourself you stand for something else and take pride in it regardless of what it makes you in the eyes of the mainstream (e.g. Torres is Atletico Madrid, who gives a f*ck about Ronaldo; Dean Ambrose leaving WWE)
(-) Say like on Simpsons "Now if you'll excuse me I've got cartoons to write." In other words just focus on what is immersive to you. I guess it could be as simple as saying "Now if you're done making me feel inferior, I've got to get back off leeching off my paycheck that I have despite being lesser."

anything can become true at some undetermined point in the future (as Ajay said) (unless something better replaces it)

That includes owning property in cupertino. It just takes longer than others.

Or being good at your job if given long enough.

Or your business idea becoming profitable (which is why we say timing is everything, and that a business needs a reason to exist beyond money. e.g. putting smiles on people's faces as WWF did through the good and bad times)

It's also why you can't just inest for the sake of a numerical balance. Eventually you will get there but what will you have sacrificed while waiting for it to happen? (it's why money is to be spent, not hoarded, and why living for experiences is a higher goal)

Also every dynasty comes to an end (in sports or beyond). Whatever it stands for is not intrinsically the best, but circumstantially.

it's also why your physical hardware will eventually be worthless. Whatever it provides lastingly will only be intangible (just like grades vs lessons in grad school).

Maybe one way to stop feeling inferior in your career is that your ultimate destination is not exactly the same as the other person's. The other person (Manuwela, Siddhi) may literally see nothing beyond money.

To me, what I accumulate along the way is as important. So doing things more immersively than purely results based may imply slower growth (and to a different target).

#soccer

In a strange way, even your favorite soccer team's journey is best consumed without caring what is happening at other clubs, just like professionally it is best to ignore others trajectory and focus on your own. Seeing others' success getting such disproportionate attention doesn't serve a positive purpose. If anything, it makes you copy the wrong strategy and base your motivation on the wrong incentives.

It wasn't always that way. TV coverage was more scarce before the streaming became normal so you were forced to look on at others success (unless you lived close to the stadium).

Now there is just too much content to consume across the league. I wouldn't be that interested even if man utd were in the CL final this season.

I think older stadium-going fans have been this way for generations.

When watching a tiktok video of one relatively attractive female who was dressed up in a skeleton jumpsuit hiding the hair completely, there was literally no sexual arousal. In some videos she had a short skirt over it, bringing back a large element of beauty instantly. This made me realize just how little is intrinsic to the single subject (such as Poorvi or Manuwela who I can't stop feeling inadequant to).

skirts imply vaginas
moist lips imply vaginas
high heels imply penises
nipples imply penises

long hair is conditionally assicated (recursively) with femininity (weakness? dominatability?)

Implication: females are not intrinsically more beautiful. They just carry decorators that trigger the male brain. Don't feel inadequate.

In fact, even before a boy develops body hair or rough skin, much of his physical nature is almost identical to a female who has not used agents like makeup, moisturizer

It's not like mom or Ketki who openly share every last difficulty (and it's why my relationship with Ketki is so special).

Others look at me, rightly or wrongly, as intelligent, well qualified, a good writer, a genius etc. and it makes me as embarassed as when I praise others because in my case I either see those as untrue or just a disguise for the difficulties which I spend a lot more time thinking about than my advantages.

There isn’t a singular common target to measure success.


You’re more likely to feel this when you are obsessed with what the other person is doing more than what you yourself are doing, and you take more pleasure in them failing than you succeeding.

[8:28 PM, 2/16/2024] sridhar.sarnobat@gmail: I pedestalize Poorvi (and other attractive girls) and if I try to tell myself that they are imperfect and are just human beings too with quirks like me then it goes in one ear and out the other. I almost want to believe that such girls are perfect so that I can dream that an ultimate prize exists. 

Now I'm seeing the similarity with my mom that we were discussing earlier. She wants to believe that there are better people out there than us even if there aren't. It somehow is a desirable to think perfection exists and that if we had it, we'd be happy. Our misery is rooted in not having perfection.

Feelings of inadequacy to poorvi

She's beautiful
She's successful, and will be more so than me
She doesn't look up to me or need me for anything
Her lifestyle and social circle is more exciting than mine
She'll be richer than me
She's a nice person

The truth is, half of these are more like being EQUAL to me, not superior. And since I can't prove I'm at least equal, I tell myself she's superior so that I don't get an painful shock later


Counter thoughts

She's chubby
She'll be held back by family duties
My social aquaintances are still healthy
It's not what you earn. It's what you invest
I'm also a nice person
If she's no longer coming to the US I will still carry that title
My intellect is rarely exceeded even if my earnings are
My girlfriend is just as beautiful
Her mom is an aggressive networker which brings her advantages
I have an MBA
She's closer to 30 than 20
Ketki is still my ally
I'll still be the source of wealth of family history

Others aren't concerned who is better or worse (eg Nikhil). They just tackle their next challenge and never give the relative measurement a thought. 
Which is how it should be for everyone

It may well be that the less attention I pay to ongoing metrics and reconvene at the end of our lives, I'll have done a lot better than I fear I will relative to her. And I will have ended up in a happier living in the meantime

Everything that actually is superior about me my brain rejects as temporary, unprovable, incomparable (eg male beauty is not as desired as female beauty) or due to privilege (rich parents). If only I could do the reciprocal I'd probably be at least more accurate then than I am now. Being in a male dominated workplace also sucks for women (and would suck for men in a female dominated one)

Don't forget my superpowers in photo cataloguing, notetaking and my command line ability.

As I feared, Manuwela is not on a higher plane of existence than the average woman. Most women are the same - good and bad (high pitch voice, soft skin but cellulite, as well as the things that happen to all humans when not cleaned). The sooner I accept this the more I will enjoy my life

even people who have something you don't (e.g. a job at Google) won't last forever. Everything has an end date.

A spectacular example is a wedding. You are treated as more important than you really are (which I don't condone). And after it people just disappear like you never existed, or they got out of you what they could (it feels like they are showing attitude to you and trying to pretend they don't care anymore to elevate their own self worth - even if in reality that's not what they are thinking).

This is also why I'm uncomfortable with big weddings at the beginning of a relationship. It would be better after 5 years of being in a stable relationship.

#inferiority

Many Indian girls on tiktok show ugly child photos of themselves

Implication: it's not some inherent beauty. a) It's testosterone fueled male desire for most youthful females  b) beauty can be manufactured or manipulated

#inferiority

sometimes it makes no sense congratulating someone on attaining something that materially benefits only them. The reward itself serves the purpose of making the beneficiary feel good.

e.g. buying a car, making money in the stock market, doing well in exams

come to think of it, I can't think of anything at all. Maybe for hard work that benefits someone else (e.g. gaining a new client deal)

I am guessing that Indians get a lot of their knowledge from (unsubstantiated) word of mouth. They just assume everything they are told is true (e.g. 'at Intuit we use Spring by default). It's very hard even at a peer reviewed journal level to believe bold generalized claims without critical thinking.
 
implication: don't think that indian peers are 'in the know" more than you, they may well end up no better off than you in this regard (e.g. leaving Cisco for Paypal)

Srishti Gautam, a true gryffindor(might be a little bit of slytherin too)

Well If I were a guy, there would not be a moment where anyone can find even a single hair on my head. You just have to visualize it to get the same feeling. No hair, no more worrying about oiling and keeping them healthy and stuff, no more timetables for washing, no more wastage for 15-30 minutes on setting them right, no more of them interfering in your sleep, no more of them in your eyes while riding a bike.... just a beautiful sunny day with one less tension. 
Yeah but I am not a guy... coming out of my dream world now. :P

#inferiority

It might be an insightful exercise to reverse the roles on people you envy:

Suppose you had everything that you are envious of them for, and they didn’t have it. Would you feel they are doomed to failure like you are fearing of yourself? Probably not. You’d just consider them as caterpillars that have yet to blossom into butterflies but whenever they do you will be their near-equal (which is all I really want. I don’t want to be their full equal or better; and this is perfectly manageable)

I’m just afraid of letting go of my fear (to coin a paradox), because I don’t know any  other form of motivation in my life.

=== Desire is endless ===
#inferiority

It’s a cliche to say there will always be something you want but don’t have, regardless of how successful you are.

This might not feel reflective of reality, by consider being a Real Madrid or Barcelona fan. Even if you win a league or Champions League, you still will be judged as nothing special. You need to win multiple, or you need to have done it with less resources when the club wasn’t as big to be remembered as truly great.

So in life goals, even if you attain everything you will still see yourself as inadequate unless you do more that what you have done.

I am guessing that Indians get a lot of their knowledge from (unsubstantiated) word of mouth. They just assume everything they are told is true (e.g. 'at Intuit we use Spring by default). It's very hard even at a peer reviewed journal level to believe bold generalized claims without critical thinking.
 
implication: don't think that indian peers are 'in the know" more than you, they may well end up no better off than you in this regard (e.g. leaving Cisco for Paypal)

#inferiority

It’s a cliche to say there will always be something you want but don’t have, regardless of how successful you are.

This might not feel reflective of reality, by consider being a Real Madrid or Barcelona fan. Even if you win a league or Champions League, you still will be judged as nothing special. You need to win multiple, or you need to have done it with less resources when the club wasn’t as big to be remembered as truly great.

So in life goals, even if you attain everything you will still see yourself as inadequate unless you do more that what you have done.

Well If I were a guy, there would not be a moment where anyone can find even a single hair on my head. You just have to visualize it to get the same feeling. No hair, no more worrying about oiling and keeping them healthy and stuff, no more timetables for washing, no more wastage for 15-30 minutes on setting them right, no more of them interfering in your sleep, no more of them in your eyes while riding a bike.... just a beautiful sunny day with one less tension.

It might be an insightful exercise to reverse the roles on people you envy:

Suppose you had everything that you are envious of them for, and they didn’t have it. Would you feel they are doomed to failure like you are fearing of yourself? Probably not. You’d just consider them as caterpillars that have yet to blossom into butterflies but whenever they do you will be their near-equal (which is all I really want. I don’t want to be their full equal or better; and this is perfectly manageable)

I’m just afraid of letting go of my fear (to coin a paradox), because I don’t know any  other form of motivation in my life.

Marina, like Asku, said you don't need to be as good as a male to get a certain job. You'll get preferential treatment

Even if this isn't 100% true, it's nice to hear from Marina that this is half true

Same way I feel inferior to attractive girls because boys come to them asking for dates, when it comes to career people in QA or business analyst need to go looking for jobs rather than jobs finding them

Furthermore, the way you get spammed with a lot of recruiter emails, attractive girls get spammed with a lot of junk interest. It's not as great as it sounds

=== nonsensical congratulations ===
#inferiority

sometimes it makes no sense congratulating someone on attaining something that materially benefits only them. The reward itself serves the purpose of making the beneficiary feel good.

e.g. buying a car, making money in the stock market, doing well in exams

come to think of it, I can't think of anything at all. Maybe for hard work that benefits someone else (e.g. gaining a new client deal)

I am guessing that Indians get a lot of their knowledge from (unsubstantiated) word of mouth. They just assume everything they are told is true (e.g. 'at Intuit we use Spring by default). It's very hard even at a peer reviewed journal level to believe bold generalized claims without critical thinking.
 
implication: don't think that indian peers are 'in the know" more than you, they may well end up no better off than you in this regard (e.g. leaving Cisco for Paypal)

Srishti Gautam, a true gryffindor(might be a little bit of slytherin too)

Well If I were a guy, there would not be a moment where anyone can find even a single hair on my head. You just have to visualize it to get the same feeling. No hair, no more worrying about oiling and keeping them healthy and stuff, no more timetables for washing, no more wastage for 15-30 minutes on setting them right, no more of them interfering in your sleep, no more of them in your eyes while riding a bike.... just a beautiful sunny day with one less tension. 
Yeah but I am not a guy... coming out of my dream world now. :P

#inferiority

It might be an insightful exercise to reverse the roles on people you envy:

Suppose you had everything that you are envious of them for, and they didn’t have it. Would you feel they are doomed to failure like you are fearing of yourself? Probably not. You’d just consider them as caterpillars that have yet to blossom into butterflies but whenever they do you will be their near-equal (which is all I really want. I don’t want to be their full equal or better; and this is perfectly manageable)

I’m just afraid of letting go of my fear (to coin a paradox), because I don’t know any  other form of motivation in my life.

=== Desire is endless ===
#inferiority

It’s a cliche to say there will always be something you want but don’t have, regardless of how successful you are.

This might not feel reflective of reality, by consider being a Real Madrid or Barcelona fan. Even if you win a league or Champions League, you still will be judged as nothing special. You need to win multiple, or you need to have done it with less resources when the club wasn’t as big to be remembered as truly great.

So in life goals, even if you attain everything you will still see yourself as inadequate unless you do more that what you have done.

[8:28 PM, 2/16/2024] sridhar.sarnobat@gmail: I pedestalize Poorvi (and other attractive girls) and if I try to tell myself that they are imperfect and are just human beings too with quirks like me then it goes in one ear and out the other. I almost want to believe that such girls are perfect so that I can dream that an ultimate prize exists. 

Now I'm seeing the similarity with my mom that we were discussing earlier. She wants to believe that there are better people out there than us even if there aren't. It somehow is a desirable to think perfection exists and that if we had it, we'd be happy. Our misery is rooted in not having perfection.
[8:29 PM, 2/16/2024] sridhar.sarnobat@gmail: (similarly even though Silicon Valley is almost literally perfect for me, I want to believe there is somewhere else better that I could move to and that it would make me happier...Los Angeles, Dallas,....)

Well, since ik their family better than you do, you shouldn't worry too much. They have an advantage, sure. But nothing lasts forever, and you're also from different generations. There's no need to compare yourself with them. I can guarantee you 200% that your moral character is better than theirs ever will be. In fact, the reason for vijay's worsening mental health is anu.
