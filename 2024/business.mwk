why some good ideas fail, while others succeed.

I think a big part is as simple as being "too soon."

XSLT might have been more useful if HTML5 was out

More thorough list:

(-) right place wrong time
(-) not enough demand / alterative satisficing
(-) lack of complements / funnel to reach your product (imagine map reduce without Google.com or Facebook without smartphones)

even these aren't fully distinct. The demand and complements may be there in the future but not now.

All you can do is use paranoid research to be ready for prime time.

The HBR at 100 book containing an article mentioning Kodak and paranoia implies this.

in the EPL for owning top quality players, the scarcest resource is not transfer funds but minutes on the pitch (i.e. experience). Stockpiling talented players doesn't accomplish what is intended.

It's also a tangential reason not to get alarmed when a rival purchases a fantastic player. The benefit is limited to what you can buy of a single player's experience.

Automating something doesn't deal with edge cases which is very annoying for customers like me (e.g. chatbots for making changes to INTERNATIONAL flight tickets). Manual solutions (like direct dialing to human support) work in ALL cases (even if they require more effort by the producer, it is usually less for the consumer; in fact this is how customer neglect starts. You're more interested in cutting costs by victimizing your least profitable customers).

#disruptive
#business

The reason businesses can't switch focus to disruptive technologies is because of the revenue (or revenue growth) they'd sacrifice (opportunity cost). Shareholders of Kodak and Blockbuster won't care about 3 quarters from now if next quarter is bad (unless we're already in a recession).

This is why having a CEO who is already a majority shareholder allows one person to do what's best rather than a consensus.

This is where corporate soccer clubs have a problem. Decision by consensus for smooth steady growth instead of maximizing lifetime value with bumps along the way.

You could argue that when a company is publicly traded, there are no real victims. Everyone just takes their funds elsewhere while customers buy from a newer producer (but in the case of soccer clubs, the customers suffer).

product, technology and lesson lifetimes coincide with the lifespan workforce

I've already seen this with the stock market. The great depression came back in 2008 because the lessons of the 1930s had gone to the grave with the people who lived through them.

But now I'm wondering if the same is true with java. My paranoia that it's yesteryear's technology may be premature, and in reality it will survive as long as the college graduates of the late 90s are still working (same way C/C++ lived on after 2002 because the graduates from 20 years earlier were still part of the workforce). When the 2002 graduates retire, maybe there will be a proverbial cord cutting/

I guess you could say the need for hardcore programmers, percentage wise, is less than the old days as long as the scalar/absolute number is enough to sustain (and regenerate) the base technologies (like operating systems). There is a minor demand for C/C++ programmers even in 2024.

When we say history doesn't repeat itself but rhymes, what we mean is that the nouns/entities may change but the verbs and sentence structures can be framed as analogous. Java in 2024 is to C/C++ in 2002, while Python in 2024 is to Java in 2002.

(-) Most companies, even loved ones, don't do well and get acquired (multiple times if it's really bad)

(-) A large number of brands get traded between a small number of holding companies. Don't be fooled about how frequently powerful entities come and go.

(-) If you can't make good personal investments, you probably aren't going to succeed in owning a corporate business (you can OPERATE one with engineering skill, but not profitably as an executive). Hmmmmm, I'm not convinced about this - what about family businesses?

Also, you can be ruthless in stock ownership but you can't be ruthless with managing employees.

(-) If a company is owned by a financial firm, it probably failed and its assets got seized by lenders

backward compatibility can be a competitive advantage. Python is not, so scripts will need repairing.

Java is but tools are not single file binary (though JDK11 script mode might be good enough). I wonder if C is backward compatible.

unfortunately most humans don't care about the past so my tools built on most platforms are not compatible. I need to give the middle finger to such languages.

Hmmmmm, even machine code wont be backward compatible as x86 to amd64 did in the 2000s. So native binaries aren't a surefire solution. Unless java keeps its promise, bourne shell may be the only one, but that lacks features.

Maybe javascript is.

I'm not good at creating new tools quickly. I need my tools to accumulate over time without needing any porting. I must choose wisely (and granularize wisely).

WWF's big market and big budget for sure was an advantage but there were other factors too.

Most significantly, being in the wrestling business for so long, there were learning economies. Your lessons (both successes and failures) from previous years could help you put on a better product in subsequent years (e.g. selecting appropriate PPV theme songs).

(-) market access
(-) learning economies over time

Choices:
(-) brand positioning as more than just wrestling (for more ad revenue)
(-) aggressive branding through repetition of names
(-) marketing to children (e.g. toys, ice cream)
(-) investing in cutting edge technology (e.g. camera quality) and high end production (e.g. entrance music, ring skirts, screen graphics) and broad communications platforms (magazine, vhs, infomercials, ppv, later website)
(-) exclusive rights aggressive deals (cable blocking competitors)
(-) hyperproducing content (from syndication to live TV in later years), expanding wrestlemania to 2 nights (at the expense of burnout of talent)

Common Business Misconceptions: • First-to-market wins • Inventiveness is good'because evolution tells us so • Best technology wins • Best marketing wins

Two of today's most influential management theorists, C.K Prahalad and Gary Hamel, have lent their authority to this position. First movers, they argue, can reap benefits in lots of ways: by establishing a monopoly, however fleeting (as Sony did with the Walkman); or by setting standards (as Microsoft did with DOS); or by dictating the rules of the game (Wal-Mart and hypermarkets). The losers, on the other hand, are consigned to a treadmill of catch-up and cost-cutting. [Economist, March 16-22, 1996]

the real success goes to "early leaders"'firms that entered the market an average of 13 years after the pioneers and now have a market share three times the size of the pioneers.

One reason for the success of early leaders is that pioneers often fail to conjure up a mass market. When a product is first launched, its quality is often low, its price high and its applications limited. The personal computer fell into this category, until software firms developed spreadsheets and word processors.

Much the same happened in the case of the video recorder (VCR). America's Ampex, which pioneered the technology in 1956, charged about $50,000 for its early models and sold only a few. It made little effort to cut costs and expand its market. Japan's Sony, JVC and Matsushita, by contrast, saw the potential for mass-market sales and set out to make a video recorder that would cost $500'a goal that took them 20 years to achieve.

In many cases, including Ampex's, the first mover was content to have pioneered the technology, believing its breakthrough was enough to bring market leadership. Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems invented the PC in the mid-1970s, but ceded market leadership to latecomers (such as Apple Computer and IBM) that invested heavily to turn the PC into a mass-market product.

Implication: make your products timeless, don't rely on a shiny new coat of paint aesthetics to drive sales. It's an expensive way to try to make money.

Minimal branding (e.g. latex instead of packtpub) can help, but you also have to be disciplined about including information that is likely to become outdated in 5 years.

WWE shouldn't acknowledge AEW etc. by giving it publicity. It should focus on itself by branding & positioning itself for the mass market.

#economics

growth happens when consumers take on debt.

after a bad experience, they'll stop taking on debt. The producer will earn less income, and so will also not grow (e.g. not hire as many workers).

an economic reset is when consumers stop taking on more debt.

In an all-cash non-leveraged economy, growth would probably be miniscule like in the UK.

This video explains a lot about politics and economics:


https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n7irOJhbwUE

Germans, Spanish, British and Dutch each had their own empires to perform segregated trade with (this is why western europe is so rich). The countries in each empire did not overlap (i.e. the trade networks were disjoint).

Then America broke off with independence from the British empire, and eventually outgrew everyone during the post world war boom (same could now happen with China).

Everyone now participates in the American trade economy except Russia.

The US Navy polices the trade routes, otherwise pirates may steal cargo for their own survival (this is where the term piracy comes from).

The Silk Road is one trade route.

The "rust belt" got its name from the metal product manufacturing being abandoned.

Ongoing novelty requires a lot of up front investment which doesn't result in much observable benefit (maybe later).

One way to remedy this is to monetize what you have latently built up unintentionally (e.g. WWE not hosting a PPV in the UK for over 20 years. The fans were loud). WWE does this as much as it's suboptimal for me (e.g. not having HOF after 1996 which was disappointing).

value creation through integration

there are lots of solutions out there where value is broken into tiny fragments (e.g. commandlinefu entries) but on their own they're not that useful. In the context of other similar commands they are more valuable because for example you can compare commands and see what the delta does.

Emphasizing something as a delta is better than just stating what that something does (e.g. ls vs ls -l ; imagine how much harder it would be for a newbie to understand what the -l does without the context of what the canonical ls does).

stable customer base first, upsell for profitability

I may have previously thought profits must be built in from the very start but after seeing merger and acquisition history on Wikipedia, I see that profitability is such a treacherous thing that it's impossible to predict and build on top of.

It's more realistic to build a critical mass equilibrium ecosystem and then on top of that find ways to make profits on a segment on those customers.

Facebook was not profitable for a long time. But it built a solid user base through good experience. 

This can be done either by upsellling, or by spamming the customers who weren't previously subjected to it. Sadly, even Facebook did the latter (I guess shareholders won't settle for anything less than squeezing every last drop of profitability if the detriment can't be measured - only when a disruptor like Robinhood comes in and changes the rules will an incumbent up its standards; same with WCW giving away PPV matches on free TV).

Implication: build a good product first. As a separate effort, think about how you can monetize the good customers base (ideally without turning the existing customers away).

Even Redmen TV and Anfield Wrap built a great customer experience and only later started with the obnoxious revenue streams.

To be profitable, you need to extract more money from customers who don't care or from products they are still happy to buy

Eg when I'm in India I really don't care if Uber costs $20 instead of $10 if I'm just using it on vacation a couple of times (and it gives the other benefits like air conditioning, not having to talk to the driver, arguing about the price, refusing the destination after 6pm)

aging is like a jumping off point. You stop discovering new things because it involves giving up what already works to make way for something that you can't easily use productively.

the middle class didn't exist until the industrial revolution. THere were monarchs and their delegates who held all the wealth by tile (lord, nobleman etc) and everyone else (peasants).

While WWI destroyed Europe, the US profited by selling goods to them and swooping in near the end to help break the stalemate. Then comes WWII. Once again, the rest of Europe is destroyed and even the great British Empire has exhausted itself. The new USSR expended millions of soldiers fighting, much more than the US. This leaves the US in a superb position as having no realistic competitor outside the USSR. Come on Cold War

If you are unconvinced that cross-selling from economies of scope is a real advantage, remember when you tried to buy a second internet provider. I chose AT & T over Verizon because I had an account already (from wireless). Thus Verizon didn’t give me live chat.

On the other hand, it’s harder to perform natural selection on AT &T when they have a stranglehold over you like this. And it’s harder to identify huge bills.

let’s see who is willing to register a new account rather than buy services from something you are already registered with (AT & T internet vs Verizon)

Affordable products are usually mass market products that are affordable because of economies of scale. But unless the mass market have a lasting need for the product, you can expect the product to have a limited useful life.

Implication: I’m not sure. Expect mass market products to be minimal satisfaction at best?

(I’m thinking about this as I discover that McDonalds doesn’t carry Minute Maid lemonade anymore. It just carries Coca Cola etc. and coffee. Coca Cola is the product with economies of scale but makes for a treacherous customer satisfaction experience - in this case, health)

Business deals basically with systems theory where money is the unit (or currency), such as in marketing, or Human Resources, or management which is with using people as constituents of a system. 

Software engineering is the use of tools (software) / machines (hardware) as constituents of a system and data is the unit of flow 

The same principles of systems theory apply in both domains, like switching costs (economies of scale)

Implication: you have decent grounding in systems theory, with the highly valued skill of being a technical person who can automate machines do carry out your business. Don’t forget how valuable your training is.

Implication 2: consider your job as a businessman who has the ability to automate repetitive processes. If something isn’t repetitive, look for manual ways to complete that goal (which will probably be quicker). E.g. hardcode, click, manually invoke a command, hand-edit a file. Don’t pander to excessive indirection that you feel forced into by default.

I guess divide vs combine art is basically maximum flow minimum cut theory

A business is by definition an effort o achieve an economy of scale for (at least) one activity/operation/procedure that the consumer alone cannot achieve.

Implication: Before opening a business, be clear what that activity (which you are going to do at a superior cost) is. Without this, your business is just a vanity business that is a pathetic, embarrassing attempt to boost your self worth using an approach that depends on the indulgence of peers in a public setting.

Implication 2: Your narrow window of time (and space?) where prospectve customers drop in (e.g. your company homepage) must communicate this activity instantly with no jargon or obfuscation or indirection. In traditional business school language, this mentioning of your core activity

Chapter 7 – Try a Lot of Stuff and Keep What Works
This chapter discusses Porras’ and Collins’ visionary company research and how they’ve come to the realization experimentation, trial & error, accidents, and opportunism were ahead of detailed strategic planning. 


Both authors describe opportunistic experimentation through trial and error as a way to make evolutionary progress. According to Porras and Collins, five ways to make evolutionary progress includes:

Giving ideas a quick try
Accept mistakes and letting the weakest die
Taking small steps to achieve small failures in order to get ahead
Persistence
Building a “ticking clock” as described in Chapter 1 to turn the aforementioned points into a process.

Coupons, loyalty cards etc. do have net measurable profit for both the business and the customer, but there are unmeasurable costs to the customer that make it negative (that most impressionable people can’t see)

E.g. you waive your right to wait and do nothing (especially for subscribe and save, but also for coupons with expiry dates) - i.e. the option value is considered to be zero.
It also restricts your choices, which prevents you from diversifying away risk (i.e. 1/n strategy). Again, since risk can’t be given a precise dollar value people don’t bother to measure it. All that can guide you is your intuition, which impressionable people unknowingly quash and businesses deliberately and disingenuously try to quash (really? you don’t want to save 10 dollars by signing up?)

When businesses “try lots of new things, keep what works”, they end up “trying to fix something that isn’t broken”

This is why you shouldn’t have software versions. When something works, leave it alone and create a different one and see which one wins (ok there will be inertia but you can make the new one backward compatible so users don’t lose all their data).

Let the old replace the new though turnover, don’t force legacy users to learn new things every few months/years

I suppose this is why we have “revert to classic interface” but once you put something out there, you have an ethical obligation to support it forever. Or at least until the percentage of remaining users is so tiny that it takes resources away from supporting more recent legacy versions)

#business

Making an excellent product is easy, if you are given enough money. But the key is to continue making money off it when it has aged past its payback time. If the shelf life / useful life of the product is no greater than the time to recover the cost of making it, it's of little business use (unfortunately).

Same with writing software. It can do the job until the technical debt makes the product unmaintainable, at which point you're no longer making money off it. A small, reliable, robust long lasting program that survives decades will pay you back many more times over

Same with any purchase you make. It may be a perfectly usable product, but if you need to buy a new one after barely paying off the old one its benefit is overall lower.

This is why buying Apple products is worth the cost - they may take longer to pay off but they continue to be pleasant to use after that period, so you're saving money by not having to replace it so soon.

And if they’re recruiting customers or employees aggressively disingenuously under the guise of the label “non profit” rather than directly seeking funding, their meaning of non-profit is not the same meaning that the common public understand it as.

It’s not enough for a business to do something cheaper than a competitor. What happens after that competitor reacts, which they will do if it’s profitable (if it’s not, there’s a good chance it won’t be for them. Or the only other way they’ll ignore it if they have more profitable projects of heir own to pursue)



Having a good idea that has a market isn’t enough. What do you do after it’s reached equilibrium? You can start sticking ads on it, in which case existing users will avoid it, while new customers will choose something less disruptive (I feel display ads are too intrusive to ever be a good idea), or better would be to use it as a funnel entrance to profitable products.



Try lots, keep what works - make lots of static sites with minimal but focused content (e.g. Bollywoodbutts.com!)

emirates

They would not allow me to change the passenger name when I bought a ticket intended for an elder family member, but with my email address and payment details.

They said I'd have to cancel and rebook the ticket, which would involve a cancellation fee of $170 (more than half the price of the ticket). This was only 30 minutes after the incorrect booking.

The reason I made the mistake was because it was asking for an email address, payment details etc. and it wasn't clear that the same information would be reused for the passenger name. I entered my own name thinking this was part of account registration.

I asked to speak to a supervisor who turned my minor honest error away saying they cannot waive the cancellation fee or change the name without essentially paying $170.

This is how I understood the Economics behind all-you-can-eat-buffets:-

Since they are cooking/baking food at a very very large scale, they are practicing Economies of Scale. Economies of Scale is essentially producing at a large scale to bring out the cost of production. They will pay lesser wages, overhead expenses like rent, gas, electricity etc. So, their cost will be lower. Win for Restaurant.

Since the restaurant is a buffet where people have to serve themselves with whatever they like, they are saving other costs too like WAITERS! Again, they are reducing their costs. Win for Restaurant.

There is also a balance between expensive & cheap dishes. Usually, buffets will have more cheap dishes than expensive dishes. For instance, snacks are served first. The prospect of unlimited snacks makes the person greedy and he/she gorges on it till he/she feels full. Then, comes the main course. By this time, the person is already so full that he/she eats lesser main course. Now, if you think about it, main course tends to be more expensive than the snacks. So, Win for Restaurant.

People go to the buffet with a set mentality of making the most of their money. They want to maximize their satisfaction ie. Eat the most. However, again, with the prospect of an unlimited buffet, their greed takes over and once their satisfaction is maximum, it slowly becomes negative ie. the satisfaction derives from the buffet initially rises, then becomes maximum and then falls. This is nothing but law of Diminishing Marginal Utility. This is why you see exasperated faces after a buffet.

Also, people tend to eat more when the prices are high. They will eat lesser if the prices are low. So, in buffet’s, prices & consumption are directly proportionate. It is kind of ironic if you ask me but it is because people will eat more to fulfill their value of money. (Read Up More- http://www.foodpsychology.cornel...)

I purchased one service. Then they said they needed me to pay more to be able to provide any meaningful service, so I did. Then they asked me to pay even more before they could provide what I wanted, so I did again. They asked for a 4th payment before they were willing to provide service as per their description and it has been almost a month that I have been a paid subscriber in which I have received almost no service. I cannot afford to pay to get the services I was advertised so I'd like to request a refund rather than wait and see if they will provide me anything before the membership expires.

When I asked them to provide me with an update on what work they have done so far, they did not answer my questions properly and instead were asking me to pay more money after I had explicitly told them to stop asking and to deliver whatever I had payed for.

A number of issues relating to financial measures were discussed:
??? They are not consistent with today???s business environment in which most value is created by intangible assets.

most or- ganizations choose financial measures related to three areas: growth, prof- itability, and value creation.

Gross margin, net income, and profit as a percentage of sales are all typically used.

Customer satisfaction, market share, retention, and cus- tomer profitability 

To develop a customer value proposition, many organizations choose one of three ???disciplines???
Operational excellence.
Product leadership.
Customer intimacy. 

They don???t look for one-time transactions but instead focus on long-term re- lationship building through their deep knowledge of customer needs.

make hard choices to stay ahead of the competition: ???less product variety, the courage not to please every customer, forging the whole company, not just manufacturing and distribution, into a single focused instrument.

???Product availability,??? ???inventory turnover,??? and ???stockouts??? would be closely moni- tored.

Customer-intimate organizations recognize that their clients have needs beyond which their product alone can satisfy.

???training hours on client products.??? 
???total number of solutions offered per client.???
???share of tar- geted customer spending.???
???Percentage of employees with access to customer information???
???Number of customer awards received???
???Number of staff at client locations??? 
???hours spent with customers???
???number of referrals received from existing customers???

could monitor transaction ease by exam- ining the number of fields into which the customer must enter informa- tion or the number of abandoned transactions.

appy employees really do drive finan- cial success a

employees must have the ability to manipulate knowledge through the use of physical and nonphysical tools. 

Track the percentage of employees who meet their personal development plan goals. Don???t make it an an- nual measure. To motivate action on this important task, ask employees for quarterly or even monthly progress updates. 

attempting to offer employ- ees an environment that facilitates and encourages them to adopt bet- ter lifestyles.

encourage trained employees to share their newfound knowledge with their peers and networks in the company.

Businesses keep changing their product design because

1) they need to cut expenses to boost profit to recover their up front non profitable sale prices (even Apple do this - I forget in what way. But I’d like to think that is more natural selection / pruning than skimping)

2) the market keeps changing and you have to put your money where the majority of people are (foolishly) willing to spend rather than where the smart people judiciously but heavily spend (e.g. economy TV by a company you haven’t heard of and will not exist when you need replacement parts or accessories)

Eg Mac monitor with built in computer will eventually fail due to the computers non upgrade ability but that won’t stop short sighted people from buying them initially

Promise in exchange for commitment trick
(Verbal agreement Instead of trial)

Companies try to get you to make big up front investments and promise you it will work, but say it won’t work if you just try it and don’t stick to it religiously

Barbara from the Hoffman Institute was doing this to me (regardless of the legitimacy of her company’s work). If she couldn’t afford me the opportunity to exit it, I cannot engage in it. 

Also such companies want a free ride, in that they don’t want to be accountable for linear progress. They try to convince you that the benefits will come only after long term use

Same with Art of Living meditation

Play to YOUR Systematic risk (reward?) profile’s maxima
Pursue the achievable relentlessly, ignore the unattainable even if its maxima much larger

Orient your approach to increase the chances of attaining the maximum of your limited potential (do not be pressured into pursuing others’ morally superior approach. They don’t have as big a stake in the outcome, and you’re missing out on better results than what you are currently getting.

E.g. Sam Allardyce is a master at this. Liverpool played Everton off the park today but Everton got a penalty late on and the match finished 1-1. I’m sure Allardyce’s tactics are - stay in the game at 1-0 even if it means you have to defend deep and don’t go forward and try and find the equalizer immediately in response to going behind.

Hmmmm, he might make an excellent Atletico Madrid manager if it weren’t for the language/cultural difference. Soccer culture wise he is just the man to compete

Also, here is another example of where soccer and business intersect. Also it’s an example of where people trying to improve their career performance or their personal productivity should leverage the lessons of the finance industry.

IT is an overhead activity in any corporation per accounting and tax laws. This is also known as a “cost center”. Being a cost center means you are beholden to profit centers for your existence and you are expendable and outsourceable to the business.

Programming is more often a revenue activity aka a “profit center”. Being a profit center means you are involved in corporate revenue generation and thus you have a major impact on the financial success of the company.

Ergo there is more money and more job security in the latter because money trumps pretty much everything in business. So most people want to know how to be skilled for profit center jobs rather than cost center jobs.
