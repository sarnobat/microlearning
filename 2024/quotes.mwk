Here is what Bjarne Stroustrup mentions about Java when asked "Is Java the language you would have designed if you didn't have to be compatible with C?":

No. Java isn't even close. If people insist on comparing C++ and Java - as they seem to do - I suggest they read The Design and Evolution of C++

 (D&E) to see why C++ is the way it is, and consider both languages in the light of the design criteria I set for C++. Those criteria will obviously differ from the criteria of Sun's Java team. Despite the syntactic similarities, C++ and Java are very different languages. In many ways, Java seems closer to Smalltalk than to C++.‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë¬¨√ÜMuch of the relative simplicity of Java is - like for most new languages - partly an illusion and partly a function of its incompleteness. As time passes, Java will grow significantly in size and complexity. It will double or triple in size and grow implementation-dependent extensions or libraries. That is the way every commercially successful language has developed. Just look at any language you consider successful on a large scale. I know of no exceptions, and there are good reasons for this phenomenon. [I wrote this before 2000; now (2012), the language part of the Java 7 specification is slightly longer in terms of number of pages than the ISO C++11 language specification.]‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë¬¨√ÜI have commented (negatively) about Java hype and ascribed much of Java's success to marketing. For example, see my HOPL-3 paper

. Today (2010), the claims made about Java are more reality based and less gratuitously derogative about alternatives. This was not always so. For example, compare the original 1995 Java white paper

 with the versions you find on the web (sometimes labelled "the original Java whitepaper"); page 69 would be a good place to start.‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë¬¨√ÜJava isn't platform independent; it is a platform. Like Windows, it is a proprietary commercial platform. That is, you can write programs for Windows/Intel or Java/JVM, and in each case you are writing code for a platform owned by a single corporation and tweaked for the commercial benefit of that corporation. It has been pointed out that you can write programs in any language for the JVM and associated operating systems facilities. However, the JVM, etc., are heavily biased in favor of Java. It is nowhere near being a general reasonably language-neutral VM/OS.‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë¬¨√ÜPersonally, I'll stick to reasonably portable C++ for most of the kind of work I think most about and use a variety of languages for the rest.‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë¬¨√Ü

Being abstract is something profoundly different from being vague. The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise. - Edsger Dijkstra

System designers who do not allow users to type far ahead ought to be tarred and feathered, or worse yet, be forced to use their own system.

I say, forget all that and ask yourself, "What's the simplest thing that could possibly work?"

A lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on my part.

UNIX was not designed to stop its users from doing stupid things, as that would also stop them from doing clever things.
 - Doug Gwyn

Software obeys the law of gaseous expansion - it continues to grow until memory is completely filled.
 - Larry Gleason

A language that doesn't have everything is actually easier to program in than some that do.
 - Dennis M. Ritchie

Saying that Java is good because it works on all platforms is like saying anal sex is good because it works on all genders.
 - anonymous

34. The string is a stark data structure and everywhere it is passed there is much duplication of process. It is a perfect vehicle for hiding information.

5. If a program manipulates a large amount of data, it does so in a small number of ways.

"In theory, theory and practice are the same. In practice, they're not."
- Yoggi Berra

"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand."
- Martin Fowler

"Programming is like sex. One mistake and you have to support it for the rest of your life."
- Michael Sinz

"Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it."
- Brian W. Kernighan

"Being a good software engineer is 3% talent, 97% not being distracted by the internet."
- Unknown (motivation)

"Optimism is an occupational hazard of programming. Feedback is the treatment." 
- Kent Beck

"C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot; C++ makes it harder, but when you do it blows your whole leg off."

Hardware eventually fails. Software eventually works.

Programming is the art of adding bugs to an empty text file.

"Nothing works better than just improving your product." - Joel Spolsky

7. "One of my most productive days was throwing away 1,000 lines of code." - Ken Thompson


"I'm not a great programmer; I'm just a good programmer with great habits." - Kent Beck

"Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning." - Rick Cook

"A program that has not been tested does not work." - Bjarne Stroustrup

"You might not think that programmers are artists, but programming is an extremely creative profession. Its logic-based creativity." - John Romero

"Tests are stories we tell the next generation of programmers on a project." - Roy Osherove

There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult." C. A. R. Hoare, The Emperor's Old Clothes, 1980¬†Turing Award¬†Lecture


"Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability." Edsger W Dijkstra, EWD498, 18 June 1975
