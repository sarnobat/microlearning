The difference between a young brain and old one is that the old one compares it against something else (rightly or wrongly)

ChatGPT may give all the answers, but I'm the one who asks the questions. So others can't catch me. THey'll be playing catchup because I'm the one with the inquisitive mind.

absolutely. This is why movies are such a wonderful construct. They are ahead of actual society in playing out alternate scenarios that could be our future, or cover subjects that are too taboo for real life characters to attach themselves to (e.g. invest incest, pedophilia, LBTQ back in the old days)

aging is like a jumping off point. You stop discovering new things because it involves giving up what already works to make way for something that you can't easily use productively.

e.g. musical tastes, favorite restaurant chains, doing namaskaram

even blockbuster and kodak went out of business because of these. It sounds easy to avoid until you realize that you are doing the same thing in your personal life.

The reason businesses can't switch focus to disruptive technologies is because of the revenue (or revenue growth) they'd sacrifice (opportunity cost). Shareholders of Kodak and Blockbuster won't care about 3 quarters from now if next quarter is bad (unless we're already in a recession).

This is why having a CEO who is already a majority shareholder allows one person to do what's best rather than a consensus.

This is where corporate soccer clubs have a problem. Decision by consensus for smooth steady growth instead of maximizing lifetime value with bumps along the way.

You could argue that when a company is publicly traded, there are no real victims. Everyone just takes their funds elsewhere while customers buy from a newer producer (but in the case of soccer clubs, the customers suffer).

product, technology and lesson lifetimes coincide with the lifespan workforce

I've already seen this with the stock market. The great depression came back in 2008 because the lessons of the 1930s had gone to the grave with the people who lived through them.

But now I'm wondering if the same is true with java. My paranoia that it's yesteryear's technology may be premature, and in reality it will survive as long as the college graduates of the late 90s are still working (same way C/C++ lived on after 2002 because the graduates from 20 years earlier were still part of the workforce). When the 2002 graduates retire, maybe there will be a proverbial cord cutting/

I guess you could say the need for hardcore programmers, percentage wise, is less than the old days as long as the scalar/absolute number is enough to sustain (and regenerate) the base technologies (like operating systems). There is a minor demand for C/C++ programmers even in 2024.

When we say history doesn't repeat itself but rhymes, what we mean is that the nouns/entities may change but the verbs and sentence structures can be framed as analogous. Java in 2024 is to C/C++ in 2002, while Python in 2024 is to Java in 2002.

believe it or not, some business trends don't come to pass. 

e.g. programmable web (whatever that was)
social bookmarking
wiki writing for non-engineers
adobe flex, silverlight & chrome desktop apps
google wave (this one is my posterchilld for not believing others are as psychic as they look)


see gartner hype cycle for more

Old technology that is educational that you may not know existed
These are great because they give you analogies which make today’s virtual equivalent more comprehensible:



telegram
transatlantic cable
printed catalogue
computer punch cards

Other fascinating extinct or dying inventions

gramophone
Cable television
Tv and radio stations with antennas (wrestling really educated me about this and cable tv)
